It showed me I have an extremely high need for impact and autonomy but was in a role with 100% structure and low visibility.

For years your identity ran on external achievement and constant activation. When the body finally can’t sustain that level of adrenaline, it shuts down motivation first. That flat, “I don’t care but I’m anxious” feeling is classic.

You’re not broken — your system is asking for recovery, not more pressure. Small things that help:  
• Short, screen-free breaks (literally step outside for 3 minutes)  
• Slow, doubled-length exhales — it cues the body that you’re safe  
• One task at a time, finished to completion, instead of scanning the whole list

reddit,1oq2poc,nnhv8xk,throwaway_advice_25,37ba4473861a7668,"I resonate heavily with this. I was the gifted kid as well, the acheiver, and then just completely burned out. First off, yes, you are depressed. I also thought depression just meant sadness and had to come to terms with the fact that depressive behaviors and lifestyle are a sign as well. You're unhappy, and your body and subconscious know it. All the little things you described: phone scrolling, doing the bare minimum at work, ordering in, etc, are just you being in survival mode. In fact, as a gifted kid, you're probably accustomed to making survival mode work and just powering through difficult times. Except in the work world, there are far fewer achievement landmarks to hit, and the hard times aren't so hard as much as they're just monotonous. You've gone too long without either a real challenge or a real reward that makes you feel alive. 

My recommendation: first, therapy tbh. It should always be the first recommendation for mental health related posts tbh. Other than that though, I recommend doing a life assessment for what you want, then figure out how you can work for it. Your job shouldn't be your life (unless it really does bring you joy just doing it), and these achievements should probably not be job related (but they could be). Pick out a life that you actually want 5 years from now and break it down: are you married? do you have a house instead of an apt? are you physically fit? Do you have a hobby or passion?  Are you making a certain amount of money more than you're making now? You get the picture. Then roadmap your way towards those things one by one. That feeling of achievement will start to bring you slowly back to life, and might even help you re-find that lost energy you had that let you get tasks done in an hour instead of a day.",3,2025-11-06T22:10:18+00:00,Positive

reddit,1oqoi4u,nnkbmlp,gaokeai,120b346225b5fa35,"I'm sorry that this is something you're struggling with. But it is much more common than you think! Please don't feel bad, with what you've been through it makes sense that you would feel some apprehension, at a minimum, about showering.




Something that helped me during times that I found showering to be more difficult than it should be, is to treat myself (if I can) and get really nice soaps, shampoos, and body washes and whatnot, so that I feel like I'm actually doing something nice for myself by taking a shower. I spent time picking out a nice-smelling fancy soap and I'm looking forward to actually using it. It doesn't have to be anything super expensive, but just things that are maybe a bit nicer than the cheapest option.




Also, if it feels like a lot of work, which I totally understand, simplify it! You don't typically *need* to wash your hair every day, for example, so you can skip that most of the time. Just make sure you use soap or body wash on the important bits, rinse off, and call it a day. It doesn't have to be a detailed 10 step routine if that's something you're not up for right now. If you want, it can just take 5 minutes to soap and rinse, and then you'll feel so much better afterwards.




You can also get some body wipes, for days that you reaaaally aren't feeling up for a shower but you feel like you should. Just use the wipes on your armpits and privates. Takes minimal effort and it's better than doing nothing at all.




Remember, be gentle with yourself. Don't try to go from 0 to 100 with this. Try to increase what you're able to do little by little. Like, if you shower twice a week now, try to get it to 3 times a week, then maybe 4. If you just try to jump into a routine that is completely against your norm as it is right now, you'll have a harder time sticking with it. Just do what you can and it should get easier over time.

I have something like this but a little different it was about shaving my hair and brush it 
As a man it's not too much important but without shaving it because of childhood trauma i was looking like twice my real age wich make me even more depressed because everyone start putting responsibility on me 
But,i changed once i asked myself how i love my self
Do i love it with missy hair and beard or without it 
I found out that i like both 
In summer i like living without it although i like it in winter
You should ask your self not about your roommate but about the person in you 
The child hiding behind your heart who didn't know how much the shower and to feel fresh and clean is important 
One of the most beautiful ideas that make depression attacks became less than before on me that i understand that there is a scaring child in me and this child need help 
Give your self that help and ask yourself this child didn't had the chance to shower everyday and use cleaning products and feel fresh 
Why should I deprive him of the same thing I was deprived of?
Feel free to ask more

reddit,1oqoi4u,nnkh7os,MikaRRR,9071ddb13845e221,"Really sorry you’re going thru this. Idk about depression, is just sounds like you have anxiety centered around this one trigger due to repeated traumatic experience  growing up. Not your fault.

I relate a bit— I didn’t  experience anything nearly as difficult in my home situation, however I also developed a not great relationship with showering due to childhood.

I spent many summers at a sleep away camp. There were lots of bugs outside and even getting inside cabins (spiders mosquitoes moths, you name it), and old cabin bathrooms also had mold etc. I would also do EVERYTHING to avoid showering because I’d finish feeling grosser than when I started. And those summers made me make a huge deal out of showering and just subconsciously try to avoid it into adulthood. 

For me, i don’t sweat a lot, so I can get by with a couple showers a week, and wash smelly parts in a sponge bath in the sink in between. Wash face 2x a day, and use dry shampoo starting the second day after washing my hair when it starts to get oily.

I also have learned the times of day and week that I dread showers the least.

Hate night time bc it reminds me of a dark gross buggy bathroom at camp. 

Hate morning bc I am not a morning person and can’t stand to be plunged right in the water upon waking up!

So I try to time my showers for late morning or around lunch time, when I’ve had my coffee leisurely but also don’t have anywhere to rush to right after. 

Having it be the part of the day when I’m the cheeriest and most awake, and giving myself the time for a full relaxing warm shower without having to rush, makes me hate it a lot less. Sometimes I also put a show on my phone loudly on the bathroom countertop to lure myself into the bathroom to shower haha, and it takes my mind off of dreading it. 

Wishing you luck in figuring out a balance for yourself! ",1,2025-11-07T09:12:17+00:00,Negative

Honestly you're probably fine. 2-4 times a week is great given our situation and if you want to do more try setting a specidic time between days, 36-48 hours inbetween.

ive been suicidal since 10 and im 18 now, exactly a month ago i attempted once but now im here breathing, alive & praying no one has to go through the same hell i did — this is how much difference a month can make, i did heal & u WILL heal too — time will heal you eventually, yes it may seem like u have been struggling for ages but trust me, this too shall pass 

i know my situation may vary frm yours & im not sure if yall did try to do this but i actually have a heart-to-heart conversation with my loved one (it can be ur parents, ur fav teacher, ur closest friend etc) — i actually told them what made me feel this way & what they can do to help me better and it actually helped me - i can promise you that ur loved ones will rather have u cry on their shoulder than they cry at ur funeral so take the first step & speak ur heart out 

AND EVEN IF YOU FEEL LIKE U DONT HAVE A GOOD SUPPORT SYSTEM, YOU HAVE ME, i am always ready to chat with you!

i felt super hopeless & i felt like my future was bleak & there was no reason for me to hold on but i came across a baby picture of mine and trust me when i said i completely broke down bcos i rmb having so much dreams & hope for my future, there was so much light in my eyes and i felt guilty for wanting to rob those hopes the younger me had; it felt like i was betraying her so i decided to hold on just a little longer for the younger me who still believed in tomorrows

you would be surprised by how much you wouldn’t regret staying just a little longer, i promise you that whatever you are going through right now WILL PASS — it did for me & it will for you

all this pain ur going through is temporary, yes it may seem like its never gonna go away but it WILL & you will find the same light i did

when i feel down & wanna sh, i started journaling [i know it sounds dumb af but i started writing things that made me upset/depressed/angry or whatever i was going through then & i burn/tear/rip the paper into pieces to release my anger/stress/sorrow]

if you do see urself getting triggered or more depressed when listening to sad music, change it to smth u love & makes u a bit cheerful — watch funny stuff; yes it may not be permanent but it will make u smile a bit & thats a big step, its progress :)

or you can go for a run, do some sports that are known to release stress - like sprints (you dont have to be good at it to do it; just take off) to actually help: understand what state u are in (are u emotionally exhausted or do u feel like there’s no point in living or do u just want relief), what hurts the most & are u afraid that u cant say anything to anyone else & if so why

as someone who was dealing with worthlessness & loneliness — YOU ARE NOT A BURDEN, YOU ARE SO WORTHY OF LOVE, YOU ARE BEAUTIFUL, YOU DESERVE TO LIVE, YOUR LIFE ISNT A STORY SO PLS DONT END IT & THERE IS MORE TO UR STORY THAN THIS CHAPTER, GIVE URSELF ANOTHER CHANCE; ANOTHER REASON

stay safe, i love you & if you do need me just text me and ill try to reply asap stay long enough to see the light thats waiting for you, you wont feel like this forever even if ur mind swears you will, you dont need a reason to stay; pls just stay & the reasons will grow THIS PAIN WILL CHANGE, DONT LET THIS DARKNESS FOOL YOU ALRIGHT :)",1,2025-11-07T09:11:44+00:00,Negative

reddit,1oqlowd,nnjw6ks,IMightBeDepress,c0b2f2cbf7bfe1fc,"Major Depressice Disorder is generic by design and easy to diagnose.  The criteria, iirc, are essentially just meeting the criteria for deoression over a certain kength of time (6 months maybe?) and reporting suicidal ideation or attempts.  More specific diagnosies can be added after a lengthier evaluation held at a later date.  Sometimes it is best to diagnose the easy things quickly so treatment can be started quickly.

If you haven't already, you may wish to look up a detailed list of side effects for Abilify to help you know what issues to keep an eye out for.  I find it interesting they went straight to Abilify, but not in the sense that I think that is necessarily a bad or wrong decision.  I wonder if they suspect bipolar disorder or  if they are avoiding SSRIs because they may cause  increase suicidal ideation/attempts in young people and thus may be contraindicated in this case?

As my current psychiatrist told me, ""the issue with these medications is that they are a pain in the ass.""  Keep an eye on them for side effects and be sure to bring up any concerns with doctors.  Mental health treatment can be a marathon.  Hope some of this helps.",3,2025-11-07T05:47:16+00:00,Negative

It can take a few months to fully kick in for some people. And MDD is pretty easy to diagnose, if your kid has been depressed for 6 months to a year, the diagnosis might be correct.

If I give you a 5 pieces of fruit that you never saw or taste, you didn't even know it's name and i told you can you judge how good is these pieces 
Your rational answer must be i don't know i didn't taste them before 
And i ask again from them look how you judge them you will judge them based on them physical characters 
If they have dirt on it or pores or anything that make the fruit isn't good 
However maybe these pores can be the mark for the beauty of this fruit 
And that exactly like humans 
Humans must not be judged by color or body shape or height or weight or anything 
ONLY by them heart 
I once read in philosophy that the only true love is when two hearts love each other no matter what else 
And in islam i read that God only judge our hearts that get affected by our sins 
He didn't look at our skin or body or anything else 

So why to worry about what the world is thinking about me 
Why i can't find a partner or why i feel i am ugly 
The reason you feel that is because you listen to humans standards 
And if you keep listening to it you will go and kill  all snakes because they are not cute as cats 
Or keep hating the way you are because human standards isn't applied on you 

Take it easy on you

Sometimes people just reach their limits. But that doesn’t make you unworthy of care, support, or love.

It's not your fault that mental health is affecting you, and not your bf's fault either.

It's gonna feel super overwhelming, completely amplified by this separation, this is gonna be one of the hardest times of your life, and it'll be so *rewarding* to get through too.  
But it's okay to be overwhelmed now! It’s your grieving period! Instead of trying to force thoughts out, sit by yourself with your feelings. Accept that they’re real but also that they’re temporary.

In the meantime, even the tiniest things will count: getting up, showering, writing down a thought, or just helping someone. Every one of those moments *is* progress.

Once we're ready to fight, create an ""Immediate Next Step List"", where you mention one thing you must do today, one thing you can do today, and one thing you'll reach out to.

You’ve already survived so much. You deserve a chance to feel safe, supported, and proud of yourself again, and that chance is still there. ❤️

Staying - will ultimately result in his mental health deteriorating enough that he can't care for either. Then what? A person should not be expected to continue to sacrifice themselves for another person the rest of their life. Some are able to do this. But those who can't, shouldn't be shunned.

reddit,1oqlxfs,nnjyvb8,Ok-Material-6325,5fe0ca3f17741cdf,"No amount of worrying or precautions can truly prevent anything bad from happening in life. Misogyny and sexual violence is indiscriminate– it doesn’t wait for the right outfit, age, place, time or circumstance. I used to be a worrywart like you, for myself as a woman, and continuing with this “how can I prevent anything bad from happening at all” mindset will only lead you to driving yourself holed up in a corner, or worse. 

What helped me is accepting that if something *can* go wrong in life, it *will* go wrong. The anxiety I felt wasn’t about the situations themselves, but whether I’d be okay or not *afterwards*, and I think that’s what’s troubling you the most here. With most events that leave people traumatized, it’s not the occurrence itself, but having to go through it alone. 

You should really let your friend know that you’re there for her if she needs any support in this aspect. You and her both need to feel that you’ll be okay. Tell it to her straight as you did here even, I’m sure she’d appreciate it.

With any kind of fear, you should try to envision the actions you would take to make the situation better first, and then think about preventative measures to avoid spiralling like this. Your friend is likely more than well equipped with precautionary measures against gender based violence– it’s all that women practically live and breathe.  

The best thing you can do to help out your friend is change the world around you. Call out any distasteful behaviour from men in your social circles, and let the women (and men) in your life know that you’re there to support them in matters like these. Kudos to you for asking a hard question.",1,2025-11-07T06:11:15+00:00,Negative
reddit,1oqlxfs,nnk18tg,Ok-Material-6325,5fe0ca3f17741cdf,"I’m gonna randomly list some practical advice I follow everyday. 

- Always look alert and confident when on your own. Check your posture, don’t be glued to your phone. 
- Walk with purpose. Look like people are expecting you somewhere and not like you’re lost or just strolling. 
- Always let someone know where you’re going and when they should expect to hear from you. 
- Follow your intuition. If something feels off about a person or situation, act on that instinct and do not suppress yourself. 


If you’re in a direct confrontation with a man, you really just have to judge the individual situation for itself. There’s no one size fits all approach. 

Some men will harass you just because they get a kick out of feeling superior to someone. Best to just ignore them. If you seem too afraid they might get a sudden confidence that they can get away with something more. If you’re too angry/confrontational, their ego might get hurt and they’ll do worse to recover. But also use your discretion to know when to be loud and make a scene. Don’t be afraid to be gross. 

If you’re ever in a life or death situation, fight like you’re already dead and have nothing to lose. If someone is threatening you with a weapon and trying to take you with them, never let them take you to a second location. They want you alive, and fighting till death is better than what would happen if they took you alive. 

Lastly, things can only hurt you if you let them hurt you. I don’t really care about sexual harassment bc. it just goes to show how sorry the assailants life is. It says more about the other person than it does about myself. However, religious women may have a tougher time believing this and processing SA, because most religions instil bodily shame (this also goes for men). It’s an important point when processing feelings of shame that come with sexual violence",1,2025-11-07T06:33:22+00:00,Negative

You might find she doesn’t expect you to protect her physically, but to be emotionally steady and respectful.

You are 19 and this sounds like the first serious relationship you were in and there is nothing wrong with feeling the way you do. I was there many times but here is the thing not a lot of people talk about. 

When you’re young its all hormones and life changes from girl to woman, boy to man and that makes things weird to say the least. 

Someone else will walk in and fill another space in your heart. Maybe you stay together, maybe you dont, but both are ok. 

After 20 years with the same woman I am now alone. I still crave her presence but I know I am toxic for her but I also hope that there is still something out there for me, ans if i can do it I am sure you can do even better. 

Dont give up because your beautiful hart is broken and you hurt.

Getting into college is a mark of intelligence and hard work.

Reasons why it's very important to get counseling at your school -

You can get academic advice, ways to deal with your problem such as taking a semester with less classes or taking a semester off.

About taking time off, having things to do is important. Sitting in your room and doing nothing makes things worse.

Sometimes, a student's parents are eager to help, but there are cases in which parents do not. It's not very unusual for a parent to say that the student doesn't need professional help.

A counselor at your school can provide things like information about therapy options for people on a low budget and lifestyle choices. There are things that cost little or nothing that help with depression. 

If you read the reviews of Dr. Steve Ilardi's book, you'll see that professionals regard it highly. He's the therapist and researcher who headed the Univ. of Kansas lifestyle-depression project and developed a program.

An online service called MoodGYM is a virtual CBT therapist for depression and anxiety. It was validated in a study by the university that created it. It's very affordable and reviews are generally very positive. 

Relaxation eases the symptoms of depression. The easiest way to calm down is to breathe slowly till you feel OK.",2,2025-11-06T20:06:22+00:00,Negative
reddit,1oq8tf1,nnhhh86,DrMykimTran,4f74ba2b60c551df,"Seek out support. For example, if you feel like the classes are not a good fit for you, talk to a counselor to see if other classes might be a better fit. Take personality tests to learn more about yourself, to see what kind of career/education is better for you. Read books on self-improvement in life, passion, career success, etc. 

You should continue attending classes or drop some, but still enroll in at least one class to keep moving forward. Being confident is not to quit, even if you are only taking one class. As you learn more about yourself through self-improvement, you can sign up for better classes, or you can volunteer or sign up for an internship if you find something that is a good fit for you. 

The key is not to quit, but to adjust. There is a difference.",1,2025-11-06T21:02:48+00:00,Positive

But here’s the thing: it’s not your job to heal a partner, and it’s not anyone else’s job to heal you either. That’s what therapy and self-work are for.

Wanting deep love is **not** a bad thing. But a partner can only add to the happiness you already have, they can’t build it for you. When we rely on someone else to fill the gaps inside us, it turns into anxiety, jealousy, and feeling “not enough,” no matter what they do. Like a drug you want more and more.

You deserve someone who supports you, listens, and grows with you, not *for* you.

The best relationships happen when both people are working on themselves, **side by side**, not trying to fix each other. Healing isn’t a solo journey, but it starts with you.

And trust me,  there *are* people who will love you deeply. But the version of you who knows her worth and doesn’t need saving? She’s the one they’ll stay for. Do what make you happy and free.

I know of no way to improve my life other than doing the incredibly hard WORK of helping myself.  
If you choose to do the work, you'll meet people along the way who can give you a hand or point you in the right direction, but ultimately, as adults - even adults who have serious problems, or who didn't have good starts in life, our life is our responsibility. Our healing is our responsibility. No one else can do it for us. And there is no magic pill, or magic wand.

It sucks. But we have to make a choice... wait or work.  
We can wait, and hope, that some miracle will land at our feet and surrender their entire self to save us, fix us, make us better.  
You can wait a very long time. Sadly, you have better chances of being struck by lightning than finding a genuine person who is willing to help you to the extent of erasing their own needs. You will, however, find lots of people willing to make/let you think that they are 'helping' - when more likely than not, the will be exploiting you.

The work is messy, it's hard, it hurts - a lot - at times. But in order to reach a better place in our lives, the only person who can get us there, with help along the way, is ourselves.

And even as I didn’t think about it I still felt like this type of comments were unnecessary. Like most of them aren’t ready to commit to having a thoughtful conversation but they comment anyway.  
  
It is also very hard for a person who struggles with depression to initiate a conversation. “PM me anytime” isn’t an initiation. OP should write the first PM which is very hard as many would feel like they are bothering the commenter are that they don’t deserve the time and attention.  
  
It would only make sense if people first made a comment about OP’s situation or thoughts, ask some questions and only then end their message with “PM me if you want to answer privately”. Now OP won’t feel bad for PM-ing someone because the commenter asked them a question so OP doesn’t initiate a conversation — it has already been initiated. As you said, it’s better not to offer to PM and as it’s a rule now nobody should do it — I’m just saying that this was one of the reasons to implement the rule so if someone is commenting on another similar subreddit (where “PM me” is allowed) try to write more than that, ask questions and discuss the topic before you offer to PM.

reddit,doqwow,f7nciyt,,,"I really appreciate this post! 

As someone who's posted here, I've received a few PMs that started off with the usual: ""Hey, how are you? I felt like you needed to talk to someone.""

I really appreciated the sentiment, but it felt like a forced interaction. Not without care or consideration, but catered specifically to be a body to talk to and knowing the intention behind it, ironically made me feel obligated to politely respond, but pussyfooted (for a lack of a better word) in my attitude. 

This is only because I know it's a sincere, but more importantly, an instantly sympathetic reaction to a sad post. It's not something I expect to be a meaningful, lasting relationship, but one born for a moment out of immediate sympathy. Like a hand on the shoulder. 

I do appreciate them. I really do, but I also can do without it, and like the moderators here have said, comments are all I need. Commiserating, advice for me or anybody relating to the OP, or a simple upvote to show support is really all I'm looking for. If a meaningful online interaction \*naturally\* precipitates, I'm all for it. I hope I'm not being too sensitive, but hey... I guess that's why I'm here haha",9,2019-11-16T09:11:53+00:00,Negative

Especially earlier this year when I started therapy and found this sub I wanted to feel better and helping others or the though of helping others aided me in that; 
I fell into the “I want to feel helpful” category despite my best intentions.

I did end up having a private conversation with someone, helping them as best I could, as often as I could and it started of pretty good no matter the time or topic. However, a couple days in I was out of advice and at a low point myself. The conversations came to a screeching halt - they couldn’t help me and I couldn’t help them. Their issues had transformed into (or had always been about) something entirely different than their original post posited and I turned into a helpee myself instead of a helper. We both went our separate ways none the better. 

After that I never replied regarding dm’s and kept it to comment chains only.

He offered to PM me and abused that. He first emotionally distanced me from my friends in the real world so I only relied on him for support. This is how he was able to make me codependent on him and would put up with other things so he could get what he wanted. 

He convinced me I had a serious mental illness so I questioned my sanity so when he made stepped over a boundary I was just being “crazy”. He worked for the NCA. He told me he could “find me easily”. He got my personal details. I was terrified one day he would turn up at my house. 

A couple of other things happened, I eventually went to his work and had to give a statement. I’m pretty sure he lost his job for talking to me at work and abusing his power to manipulate a mentally ill teenager. I had to sit in a room with a bunch of two way mirrors and hidden cameras and talk about everything. They screened my laptop. I don’t know if my video was used in court I kind of left it all behind after that.

Generally a common way of dealing with depression from a CBT perspective is things like training mindfulness and practicing it often. But this is extremely hard for people with diagnoses like ADD, ADHD to get a working routine on, I'm not saying to defend the ""PM you anytime"" but reddit is a horrendously bad forum to help people quickly, often people get replies during a week's period and some form of support group for this type of struggle, not when people are suicidal low, but still depressed enough to make it hinder their lives can be helped if we could setup some form of group chat to remind each other or give ideas of how to deal with certain situations.

Well, with your permission:

I've suffered depression/been depressed since I was around 10 yo until this year's  February (2019).
(Major depressive disorder, severe depression, you name it. The first  condition it's only a raw translation from my native language to English, although it may be different as the actual English name, sorry if I've made a mistake)

I don't  want to offend anyone here or make this condition appear to be worse than it really is, but for me, it was Hell. Perhaps I'm  lacking the proper words to describe it but for me it feels/felt like that.
Around the same age ( I've  started  my toxic relationship with depression) I've  developed anxiety disorder, I'm  still struggling/fighting against that B****.  A nasty combo.

For some reason unknown, even for myself, in some moment in that time I've started to think about both conditions as females, ladies, nothing against them obviously, they are more beautiful than men,  proved they are more intelligent than men and without the ladies we are just savages, love them all. Xp 

Now, as an adult (25 years old, male) I've took a phrase for myself, it says, more or less:

""Depression is nothing more than a sad lady knocking at our door in a rainy night. Let her in and listen carefully what she has to say, but do not let her stay. Once the rain has stopped, say goodbye to her.
Otherwise, she *Will* get into every corner of your house( Inner me, mind, etc), and kicking her out it's hard, painful and takes lots of time, wasting life. You don't  have to be rude, though, learn how to treat her, listening her words and advising her are the best way to help her and yourself. Letting her stay and being rude will start  a war between both of you, a nasty one, and in the beginning, she is always stronger than us. 
Takes years to overpower her and acquire control.
 Listen the echoes inside of you, the voice around you and read the words dedicated to you. It may be someone nice trying to be nice with themselves or he/she could be someone struggling too, trying to make you know that there's others with their own wars, some of em had lost some battles, others had won, but all of em are fighting back, see them and learn from them. A few others have lost the will to fight and this lady took their heart, alongside their last breath. I never forget them, it could have been me.
There's stairs to heaven, highways to hell and the unlimited potential we all have to evolve, let me tell you my secret ;) :you seek outside the reasons, help, strength or anything you think you need to not give up. You NEED to go and look inside, think about  it. We are amazed by the wonders in the space, maybe because we already forget the beauty of the jewels in the deeps of the planet. That's the hint. 
I'm fool and forget to mention another possibility: if the written words were made for your eyes, the voices for your eyes, or the cheers for your heart, it could be a type of people I admire, respect and decided to become one of them in the future: The friends beyond all the fight. Because you'll find a friend in almost every one of them. And they will be one (or both) of two things: and adviser/helper, like masters, to share with you where they did stumble in their path and suggest useful things.
Or your friends, doing the same as the first, and even more, much more.
They've learned to appreciate anything that shines in the darkness after living there for so long that they don't  want anybody to feel the same, and if you let me include myself with them, we will do such things because we like it, and we mean it. 
I am or I am not. Always. I'm always Too much of anything or absolutely nothing,  There's no mid points to me, I pour my soul in every thing I've decide to do, always help to anyone I can, serve the others and do good recklessly. That's one thing or two I believe in.
So, c'mon Bro, grab this hand I didn't had and take the strength I've lacked. Anytime you want, mate. That's why I'm here for.""
                                                                                                         The mind of Sun

That's a little thingy I wrote not so long ago, I've felt it would be nice posting it here,  it's  not the complete thing, it has some holes intentionally, but it's the first 80% of my own writings I've post ever. Hope it doesn't offend anyone, if it do not help you by any means, hopefully don't  hurt anyone either. I like to write, you know, my poison  of choice are poetry and philosophy  (damned poetry 😂),
And if you catch even the tiniest bit of the deep meaning it also have, you already figured it wasn't a cute this half of my life. Lived in the bottom for years, pretended to be fine bc like we all do, I didn't want to worry not even one of my love ones, I was unable to have a treatment with a psychologist or psychoanalyst, and my whole list of sins didn't help much either.
I've even tried to ""end"" myself  (sorry for this) four times.
Obviously, fortunately, unsuccessfully. 
After I've surpassed, the very first day after, for the first time in years, I've  woke up, happy. I don't  remembered the last time it happened. A couple of weeks after I've decided to believe in the things I've mentioned in my poor writing above, among others. And even more in those in the last two lines.
I didn't had anybody to help me. Support me, freaking avoid I've tried those 4 things.
I'm not fully recovered, I believe  this lady never really leave, it's always lurking but nice you won her, it's  more hard for her to regain full control. I've decided to always go beyond if I find myself a limit for anything, return anything good people do or give to me 10x  times better, if it was something bad, I'd return them something 100x better, don't  be cruel, don't lose yourself, do not treat people as bad as they are, treat them as good as you are.

Many people here would probably know what cost me to learn these things too. 
That's why I wanna help and give my full disposition when I've reply something similar.
Regardless I do like to know all kinds people.
Although I don't think of myself like a hero or anything.
I'm trying to save pain to people that haven't reach that point, help the ones there, and for all the people struggling I'm  saying: I'm here for you, if you want. Just say the word.
I don't start a chat, perhaps because I would be acting for my own selfishness at first glance.
It's  the way I respect people's desires. 
Although, I know how hard it is. 


THAT'S IT, I'VE EXTENDED MYSELF QUITE MUCH.
MY APOLOGIES HOMIES.
I ASK YOU ALL TO FORGIVE MY GRAMMAR, I'M NOT A NATIVE ENG SPEAKER, LEARNED IT BY MYSELF, STILL POLISHING IT, I'M DOING MY BEST. 
THE WRITING IT'S OBVIOUSLY PHRASES I'VE READ AND LIKED, MIXED WITH MY OWN THOUGHTS.
I USE THESE QUOTE TO SYNTHESIZE MY OWN THOUGHTS/WRITINGS.
I'm still a bit embarrassed for it.
Let me quote a hero:
""Whenever you suffer pain, keep in mind that it’s nothing to be ashamed of and that it can’t degrade your guiding intelligence, nor keep it from acting rationally and for the common good""

""My relationship to them. That we came into the world for the sake of one another.""
      MARCUS AURELIUS 

You are more than you think, stronger than you feel, loved than you believe and unique than you perceive.
Seek something you like or care about, make it a hobby. And do it relentlessly. 

Things like mindfulness, stoicism, a essay/book of a subject you like, even slightly interested in, are helpful too.  Learn more things, do more things.
Once you realize what's stopping you, bringing you down, you'll gain power over it and it will get weaker and weaker. 
You are far more than you think.
I believe that, soon you'll  do it too.

Regardless the feedback you guys give me, I'm  here.  Keep that in mind.
Why not? ;)

Good vibes homies ✌✌✌😎

reddit,doqwow,fddd1q3,,,"I'm sorry I'm very late to this topic but I agree entirely. 

I appreciate the intentions may be good, but from previous experiences there are times when the conversation reaches a natural end - but the other person simply won't stop responding. I've had three definite experiences of this in the past where after a few messages back and fourth, I just want to be left alone and continue. I don't want to remain in private contact but there's no polite way of putting this across to the other person. 

Prior to my time on Reddit, there was one particular forum I was a member of who private messaged me for many months. Probably getting on for a year. In the end, I just had to stop replying and inevitably ended up blocking that person when they continued to message me for weeks afterwards - turning quite nasty. 

As my own personal rule, I don't and haven't responded to any private messages for around a year. I don't mean to offend anyone by that but after several 'less than pleasant' experiences and then the expectation to remain in contact thereafter - I've just had to call it a day and say ""*enough's enough*"".

The crux of the issue I found is, you don’t know who you are helping. You don’t know them well enough to give that deep, personal, supportive advice they may be aching for.
As well as, being a counselor for free, though honorable, can weigh you down when dealing some people who have hours that don’t work for you or have heavier topics than you were planning and needing the help; especially if you don’t know the person well enough to know how being late, busy, or not being able to properly help an incredibly heavy topic is going to be perceived.
As was said, it also makes the receiver of the help very open to manipulation.

My own life has taught me that the best way to help people is to steer them towards counseling and genuine help that can be in their own life for them, or... if you feel the need to and the infinite patience, discipline, and love required, to genuinely change your life to help another person and be a part of their life.

I’m not saying don’t help anyone unless you can do that; but setting boundaries and clearing up expectations are incredibly important with helping!

But as I said, you don’t know who you are helping and they don’t know you.
And if you aren’t trained on how to protect yourself and the other person from that; sometimes helping people online can end up negatively for both parties.
Accusations, things taken personal, personal issues, energy levels, reading a situation properly; hard to do if not impossible over text platforms.

To all the people who have helped me over the years when they could, under different profiles and such, thank you.",1,2020-01-20T07:43:01+00:00,Positive

With all due respect this is why I personally disagree with such casual sex, you barely know someone and you’re giving yourself to them in the most intimate way. In my OWN opinion you should probably get to know someone a bit better , having some sort of idea about how they value you as a human being before just giving sex to them. You sound extremely desperate to be loved, but it seems you don’t even love yourself giving yourself to people you don’t really know like that. Correct me if I’m wrong, but it seems like you’re sleeping with people in hopes they will feel closer to you, but it’s actually doing the opposite and destroying your sense of dignity.

If u want my advice (which you don’t have to take and can discard) you should probably not have casual sex. Some people are built being able to do it, some aren’t. You seem like the latter. You are seeking connection and casual sex is not gonna give you that, sorry

People that sleep around a lot tend to be more unfaithful, regardless of their intentions. That has multiple reasons: 

1. The bar is lower. If you know the game well, you know how to get it easily. One dispute with your partner can lead to many consequences, words said that shouldn't be said or things done that shouldn't be done. Usually what matters is: are you hurt enough to do it? And people get hurt easily. 

2. For women especially: more Sex leads to more desire of Sex, which can make men insecure if they can be enough. Also: dude will be hitting on women way more than women on dudes. Which makes it overall understandable that they might get insecure. 

3. Dudes WILL insult another guy that they dislike using you. Its not about you who didn't want a relationship with that guy, even if its true (!) Its about I fucked your bitch and thats hurting to almost every man. 

Takes a special man to ignore that and still have strong authentic feelings of love. 

You might have a different perspective of Sex and love. But thats how most men see it: a power play.

My therapist and I have been working together for a long time and she has helped me realize that depression is really good at making you feel like you’re supposed to have this grand purpose…but don’t. And it’s completely fine to not have a “movie” life. Realizing this took so much pressure off me.

just to contradict myself, here are my best guesses:

if you're asking why suffering exists at all in a general/abstract sense, the cognitive science answer probably has something to do with the predictive brain and autopoiesis, and the buddhist answer has very much to do with craving and aversion, but really they're kind of the same answer. i don't know. don't worry about it. 

if you're asking about the nature of suffering and what to do about it, the buddhists have a *lot* to say about that. it's kind of their whole thing. suffering has many causes. you can undo a lot of them, especially the ones you create yourself without knowing. they can teach you how to do that. 

if you're asking why so many people are depressed, for one there's selection bias but also we are in a ""meaning crisis"" which is kind of at the centre of the polycrisis. shit's falling apart and people are struggling to find meaning in life.

If someone is getting tormented, That does not mean he is suffering, He is the same as you only he lacks the freedom of moving like you do but that does not mean he is suffering, He is bound by rules of society to unconsciously think that he is suffering, If he was a masochist then he would not be tormented but be in a state of euphoria because he is getting exactly what he wants.

Changing your behavior can improve your mood.

And that doesn't mean physical movement only. Even if just putting on music& jumping around helps the body to regulate. But it also means the mind. You don't have to have all figured out. Your best looks different everyday. But you gotta keep trying, you gotta keep moving inside your mind. Build ideas, imagine postive scenarios, be creative. 

2)Do the opposite.
Sounds easy but is actually hard. You want to stay in bed all day? Get up& move. You hate yourself? Talk kindly to you& do something you normally enjoy. You want to hide from everyone? Look for connection. You are tense? Actively relax muscles. You feel really bad? Smile for 2 minutes without reason.

3)Self validation.
The way you talk to yourself does something inside of you. And you're allowed to fake it till you make it. You can't do something & hate yourself for it? Don't say ""I'm a failure, I can never do anything right."" You may still think that but choose to say things like ""I can do it.""/ ""I can't do it just yet because I never learned to. But I will keep learning."" It sounds 100% stupid, especially if you say it out loud. And in the beginning it won't change how you think about yourself. But with time it does. And the word ""yet"" can help. I can't do it YET. I don't know this YET. This doesn't make sense YET. I don't have an idea YET. I don't feel better YET.

4) The Emotion-Toughts-Behavior triangle
What we feel affects how we think& act. What we do affects how we think&feel. What we think affects how we feel & act.

10-11 get up

11-12 feed cats, make coffee, check phone

12-1 walk for 5 minutes, eat lunch

1-4 online work, job search, emails, etc

4-5 housecleaning or house projects

5-6 make and eat dinner

6-7 work on art projects

7 + shower, prep for bed, watch shows or play on phone

In January I suddenly lost my father (He had had lung problems for the past seven years, but he was healthy and in good spirits. However, within a week, he lost all his strength and died in the hospital). 

Then I the lost my mom in June (Three years of fighting cancer. An incredible amount of money spent on treatment and, unfortunately, a bad ending. Perhaps if she hadn't done anything, it would have come sooner. But she passed away calmly, peacefully, without suffering. My last words to her the day before she died in the hospital were, ""Everything will be fine, Mom, I love you."" At 2 a.m., I got a call with the news). 

For that 3 years drank myself to unconscious every other day (I'm so glad that I work remotely). 

Although my father and I were not so close, and I felt broken when he passed away, I got over it within several months. However, when my mother passed away, I was devastated. I am still pretty much devastated, but recently, when I was very close to the worst day of my life, I decided that something had to change and started taking antidepressants, and things got just a little better. I also thought that if my mother passed away, I would too. But she did everything to make me who I am, and I don't want to nullify all her incredible efforts. 

It will probably be difficult. I understand that. I don't know if I can give advice, but just try to do what you have to do. I thought about quitting my job because I didn't have the strength to do anything. But I realized that if I did that, I wouldn't be able to pull myself out of this abyss. I forced myself to work for a month. Then another. And another. Again, things will get a little better. I hope so. I want to believe that.

Went from performing very well in highschool and turned into a completely bum when I went to college. Literally never went to a single lecture for multiple semesters in a row and rotted in bed every single day. Failed multiple courses and barely passed everything else. I'm not sure if you feel this way right now, but I know I was extremely stressed out because I felt that I had no business to be struggling at even the simplest of things. I just want to share that from my experiences, when you're in a really bad state of mind/struggling with depression, even the simplest tasks become unbearably hard. Getting out of bed can quite literally be the hardest thing to do every day (for me it still is to this day). I hope you can be less hard on yourself and know that it's normal for people to struggle like this when you're not in a good mental state. I think the most important thing to do is take things one at a time and not feel like you have to fix everything at once. Try and set small goals for yourself to try and achieve every day even if it's just getting out of bed or brushing your teeth. I'm not sure where you go to school but nowadays, most schools are generally very understanding of students struggling with mental health.

When I'm having a hard time eating, *especially* when it's been days, I'll go to the fridge and make what I call a mouth sandwich. My partner hates that I call it that but calling it something weird and funny honestly makes it feel less threatening for some reason. I also tend to get very emotional and upset at the thought of eating. 

Anyways, mouth sandwich: couple slices of lunch meat, pinch of shredded cheese, and just pour a bit of ranch(or whatever condiment you prefer) right into your mouth.

Like just cram it all in there as fast as you can, tears running down your cheeks, heart racing... Just be ridiculous who cares .. just do it for the sake of doing it. As fast as you can and slam that fridge door shut and fall back into your depression nest and recover from it all....

Women chose the bear.  Women did that drizzle-drizzle shit.  Women want the 6-6-6 man: 6 foot tall, 6 figure income, 6 pack abs.  Women sent clear signals that they don't value men.  Fine.  Women wanted us to back off, we backed off.

You may not have been part of any of this.  You may be a casualty of a war your own gender is waging.  If thats the case, you have my sympathies.  Your own sisters in humanity have made your goal infinitely harder. 

Approach men.  Some might be suspicious, and rightfully so.  But now it's to the point where you have to be direct and up front. No more subtle hints.  ""I am attracted to you and want to date you""

Depression is an illness and what can happen is that your suffering becomes so expansive, you become obsessed with it. You only have so much mental energy and if all your mental energy is focused on how poorly you feel, there won't be much left to devote to thinking of others. Therefore, you might find yourself doing things that selfishly benefit yourself without caring about the consequences for others. Hence, the appearance of losing your empathy or having your empathy reduced. This is one of the reasons why people get really frustrated with depressed people.

The important thing here is that you realized it. You feel some type of way about it. You are questioning yourself. These are all good signs and good indicators about your own personal character and the state of your depression.

Also, keep in mind that depression will cause you to be a lot harsher on yourself than you ought to be or even see your actions as much worse than they are. So keep that in mind too.",4,2025-11-06T06:43:24+00:00,Negative

and then, like you, they carry _guilt_ from feeling responsible for other people ...

using mental health as an excuse for being asshole just makes you an asshole, tho -- it's just extra steps and another shield to save your ego without having to _actively_ critique and think about your own actions

The fact that you managed to stay in a relationship of 3 years with someone like that is a sign of strength in and of itself. Sometimes things like this can be hard, my buddy just got out of a situation extremely similar to this, and is also going through these same feelings.

Id recommend getting out more. Taking a walk through a park, heading to some local shops. Maybe checking out a local concert or festival. Whatever the case, get yourself out there. You can’t meet people without going out first, so find something that looks even a little interesting and take a chance on it. Once you do, you’ll start making friends on your own naturally. Just take this time to yourself, and don’t set a deadline that you should be healed. Getting out of a relationship can be very tough, especially the bad ones, so don’t let people dictate how you should go about dealing with it, do what you feel is the most comfortable and healthy for you and grieve the way you’d like to grieve.

I know most psychiatrists don’t do vitals however after seeing your GP a few times if they mention your blood pressure is elevated ask if BP medication should be introduced. My experience is in my mid 20’s I started getting debilitating panic attacks for no fucking reason. I was one of those arrogant assholes that beleived that people who suffered from anxiety, depression, or any mental health condition were just weak until it hit me hard, agoraphobia hard. I rarely saw my GP but he has always been a great doctor.  I was put on antidepressants, benzos, and BP medication. Took a couple of months until I was my old self again. Fast forward 10YRS later, still on the benzos sporadically only, then work gets super stressful, COVID hits, my dad passes away, divorce proceedings begin, money is flying out of my account due to divorce and maintaining a sense of normalcy for my 2 daughters, I start dating someone new with 2 young kids of her own who don’t really know their father basically making me an immediate stepdad. I start becoming clammy from the moment I wake to when I fall asleep, constant tightness in my chest, overwhelming concern for everything. Psychiatric puts me on antidepressants-doesn’t work, ups the benzos significantly-definitely helps but physical symptoms rebound. Go to my new GP who informs me that my BP has been significantly elevated each visit for past few years. I ask my psychiatrist for a beta blocker that I know helps with BP and anxiety Propranolol 10MGS in the A.M 10MGS after lunch. A month later I get that relief reminding me of the horrors I endured when this wretched anxiety first hit me. This worked for me, may work for you-may not but keep actively looking to make your situation better. Needless to say I was humbled by what I endured that first episode and I very quickly became an advocate to help anyone suffering, I’d put aside my hate for anyone to help rid any one of this disease called anxiety.

I’m an early middle-aged person with no history of these conditions. I've always been a decently healthy person. I do my best to eat well and be mindful of my health.

**BUT** in the past years. I have been trying to figure out if I have developed some type of anxiety disorder that causes me to have panic attacks and be deprived of sleep.

Regardless of the day, it usually starts with difficulty falling asleep. To quote the OP, **“sometimes I keep having these recurring nightmares”** that make me twitch and wake me up. If I get up to use the restroom, I suddenly start thinking about EVERYTHING, even weird thoughts, to the point I even question myself, so I can’t sleep…

I wake up “feeling ok,” then minutes later, I feel like the world is going to end. I get jittery, foggy, a sense of panic, nausea, and even a slight fever. My body starts to feel like a bad hangover that does not go away. So, I panic even more.  This usually starts in the morning and can last for most of the day, and has led to a few seizures. Some of these psychological effects began to worsen when I was prescribed Keppra to help with my seizures a few years ago.

Do not feel bad. Going to the ER is literally their job.  
But I would suggest talking to a doctor.",2,2025-11-07T02:03:45+00:00,Negative

I saw dark clouds the cars looked small from how high I was. And then boom my biggest anxiety kicked in. I started hyperventilating my hands were tingling I couldn’t think straight. Then I got my shit together started breathing techniques and realized that no one was going to come save me. No helicopter, nothing!!

You can call doctors and get things scheduled, be responsible about it. But in the quiet moments when anxiety creeps in demanding relief and answers- rather than googling or seeking answers- comfort yourself. Soothe yourself- whether that’s talking to yourself and saying “we will get this handled and I will do what is necessary but right now we need to rest. We can’t fix or answer this ourselves or in this moment, and that’s scary. But being scared and anxious doesn’t mean we are unsafe. We are doing the right things, being responsible. We are safe. Our doctors are knowledgeable and will guide us”. Rather than trying to look 10 steps ahead, focus on what you can do in this minute. That can be a slow gentle deep breath, a sip of cold water, a cold shower to break out of panic, a heating pad or weighted blanket, turning on background noise. Just focus on getting through this minute. And then the next. Slowly.

He would be fine one minute then he would disappear and completely ignore me the next minute. It felt very unstable and I have anxious attachment so I overcompensated by texting, calling too much even visiting him at his work which is the worst thing you can do to an avoidant. 
Sadly, that didn't work out, i was too inexperienced to handle something so complicated.
My partner now is also an avoidant. But I've learned to give him space. We would agree to have a ""quiet week"" and we  would come back to each other. We would have a fight, and on top of that could be stress from work, family health scare can add to the stress load and my partner would retreat. Like he would literally only send 1 text and leave me on read and would cancel dates. I've learned to regulate how I look at the situation. That is their issues that they are fighting with. That is how they cope. Its got nothing to do with you. You give him the space and the support. Send a text every couple of days to let him know, you're here for him. What it will do is it will help you detach without you knowing (if it doesn't work out). Like you'll be used to being ignored that if he chose to disappear altogether, it won't make much difference to you. If he comes back (usually they do if they really care about you) and communication is open again, sit down and set some boundaries and guidelines for when he does this again (which he will). 
But don't walk around on egg shells for fear that it can trigger him to retreat if you do something to upset him. You let him do what he needs to do and you do what you can to support. If in time, it's really not possible to stay together, you can't say that didn't give it your all.

Like today for me i seem to be at low level anxiety, i'm not actively worrying, i don't actively have specific symptoms i just feel not comfortable in my own skin, just slightly restless, not really wanting loud sounds or bright lights and just feel off or on edge . Perhaps medication related perhaps not.

But while at low level you can sort of realise 'ok if this was a few notches higher, if i felt even more high alert, if the adrenaline kicked this up and that sets off the typical higher heart rate, maybe some dizzyness and i become even more hair triggered to thoughts and body sensations, then where would i be?' well you'd be in a state where a panic attack can hit very easily.

But notice that these things gear up, gear down, you can feel comfortable and seem fine for a few days then it kicks up a gear or there is a bolt from the blue attack and you gear down from that and so on.

Actual illnesses don't really tend to be dynamic like that or influenced significantly by thinking or catastrophic thoughts.

But this is frustrating , how dynamic it is makes you want there to be a specific thing, latch onto that and say 'i know what it is, lets fix this'

I'm so sorry your first experience with the meds was bad. I was lucky enough to tolerate SSRIs really well, and they helped me for years. Unfortunately, they seem to have stopped. I'm in the process of switching over to a SNRI. 

The most sucky thing about meds is how long they take to actually work. Usually the side effects start way too early, and then you don't actually get a chance to experience the benefits, and decide whether life is actually better despite the side effects. 

It can be a really tough journey. I'm hoping your mental health team can help you find something that helps without too much trouble.

Not every thought you have is truth. Most of the time our brain is lying to us. It’s about seeing those thoughts for what they are (mindfulness as mentioned above) and recognising this. Questioning them. It takes practice but it’s empowering. 
You can do this. Keep going. It’s like a race and you’re trying to get the finish line. You will get there. Best of luck.",3,2025-11-06T21:21:38+00:00,Negative

I never got on meds, I started meditating regularly, doing breathing exercises, venting to myself about regrets and poor decisions, praying, changing the type of music I listened to and I found some good people to put inside my life, also I quit drinking, smoking, eating beef and pork.

Still till this day I have episodes where I’m anxious or over whelmed. But I have to continue to be productive, I work in customer service and there have been moments where i felt an anxiety attack coming on, I felt light headed like I might pass out. 

I simply take some deep breaths and distract myself and eventually it goes away. 

As adults we have to find productive ways to survive, work, gain hobbies, meet new people, achieve goals, be a part of society. 

also it may be good to find the root of your issue, why are you having panic attacks, why are you so anxious, why are you always in a fight or flight state, have you tried to accept and forgive yourself and others so you can stop carrying the burden that manifests itself into pain and suffering ?",2,2025-11-06T18:33:27+00:00,Negative

The key to mindfulness is to stop thinking and being in the moment (by focusing on your breath) .

But the fact is you will have some thoughts pop in your head while you r doing mindfulness,  so when that happens , just notice the idea , don't judge it , and bring your focus back to breathing .

Start with 10 mins per day , i know it will be hard for the first time , but it will be easier with time , then try to do it twice ( in the morning and in the evening ) , 15 mins each.

But when I was in my 20s, I was heavy on the cocaine and methamphetamine so when I quit, my anxiety went through the roof I went through all kinds of feelings like you’re explaining..  it seems that the sensation of the caffeine seems to bring back the feelings of anxiety. There’s a such thing called fortunetelling where we foresee things in the future basically creating the anxiety before we even get there. You have to remember that there’s facts over feelings and sometimes your feelings lie. There is a book and I’m not trying to sell it, but it helped me a lot. It’s by Dr. Daniel G Amen. It is called. Change your brain change your life. I still sometimes get anxiety where it’s overwhelming and I can’t shift my focus but I can truly tell you that in my 20s I did it without the medication. Life has been a roller coaster so I take Xanax to sleep. I used to get anxious thoughts at night that I could not sleep because I used to use hard stimulants so my brain just wouldn’t shut off and the doctors gave me Xanax to chill out. You got this man hanging in there. I know you’re new to this, but just remember that there are facts over feelings count your blessings. Make sure you journal your weakest points and your strongest points. Write down when you felt weak and vulnerable and how you let the anxiety pass and how you felt afterwards you will start gaining strength over it and control over your thoughts. Last time I went to work off of three hours sleep I used to take Adderall with Red Bulls so I STOPPED., but I didn’t sleep well that night. I woke up with food poisoning and went to work throwing up. My anxiety started triggering everything I was at work there was no one to cover and I knew I had to get the shit done. I started challenging my thoughts I couldn’t stop myself from throwing up though, but I kept myself busy and the anxiety went away. I then got home and rested a bit. I have diabetes so if my sugar goes low, it could be bad and I hadn’t eaten anything because I had food poisoning so I drove myself to a small hospital. They helped me out with IV and some medication but of course my anxiety wanted to kick in when I was there, but then again I fought it. They gave me some medication to help me eat something light. The only anxious feelings I had after wards was being home resting. I hate not doing something. You got this man I can assure you!! Lay off the caffeine or what ever triggers you don’t be afraid of it though because eventually you will have to go back and reframe those feelings with postive ones.

breathing isn’t always the answer though. i like to breathe the rapid way, like how you do after you cry - it matches the energy of the fervor and does actually calm you down. otherwise try alternatives, maybe reassuring yourself instead of fighting yourself helps. maybe it’s music. maybe it’s no music. maybe it’s exercise. maybe it’s sitting down. baths/showers definitely help me. i hear tea helps too. having something good to smell takes you down. there are still so many options. life isn’t over 🫶",1,2025-11-07T05:13:45+00:00,Negative

For working on your thoughts, this is something I learned in therapy, but using CBT. Simply noting down these unhelpful thoughts and challenging them. Wha evidence do I have that negates this belief? And finally what is a more helpful thought I can replace this with? Everytime you challenge the old unhelpful thought with the new beneficial one, you re-route and build new neural pathways.

I hope this helped even a little. Hang in there, you’re doing your best! Give it time. You are never defined by your anxiety, it’s simply something that takes place. Observing it rather than giving it power will help you feel less affected by it.",1,2025-11-06T22:22:51+00:00,Negative

1. Get a carbon monoxide alarm for your apartment! They’re cheap and give me a ton of peace of mind. There are even some that also monitor natural gas as well! I can send you links if you want.

2. Your gas company should offer services for you - just call and say you smell gas in your apartment, and they should send someone out to check gas lines and monitor the system. Usually free of charge. If it’s not, your landlord should pay for it (if they’re a good landlord).

3. Gas ovens often give off a little gas smell when starting up. If you have a kitchen fan (that exhausts out of the apartment), or nearby bathroom with a fan, turn that on when you turn on your oven and that could help pull some of the gas out, since combustible gas is lighter than air, so it tends to rise. 

4. If the gas oven is really still freaking you out, go for a little electric hotplate in the meantime. Maybe even a toaster oven.",3,2025-11-07T03:49:37+00:00,Negative

- You acknowledged you had a problem and sought help. Congrats, you’re already ahead of the game. 
- Despite your injury and other issues, you’ve survived. You haven’t lost. 

Re: Work - Do you have any buddies at the job? If so they probably can’t wait to have you back. If you’re scared of hurting yourself again when you return - just take it easy. No one is going to blame you if you start light and slowly work your way back in. 

Re: Bills and Money - Getting back to work will definitely help. Is there a budget you can make to help tackle some of the debt? Potentially bring in some extra cash via DoorDash or whatever a couple hours on the weekends, etc?

I had an 18-day headache, followed by a stomach bug, & then gastritis. I had so many symptoms, some of which were the stomach bug, some were anxiety, some are muscle stiffness. 

It helped me to get brave & analyze each symptom. I thought I was having kidney pain, but I finally figured out it’s a tight QL. I thought my stomach symptoms were in my head/ caused by anxiety, but then my husband got sick. So I knew that was real. 

I have a birth defect that can send me to the ER if I have too many stomach issues & so when I get certain symptoms I start getting anxiety. 

 I realized after a week that my anxiety was sending me into the downward spiral of symtom leads to anxiety leads to symptom. It was hard, but I had to snap myself out of it, and that really helped. When I was finally able to do that, I realized some of my lingering symptoms are real, and I have gastritis. But I can deal with that on my own at home. A little yeast imbalance from the stomach bug. Ok I can deal with that on my own at home. I just had to work my way through each thing by itself. 

Then I read another comment in this sub. “Your body isn’t trying to kill you.” And I realized that yeah my body is strong & will fight for itself, so I just have to support it & learn to trust it again. I’m a few weeks in & getting steadily better.

reddit,1oqismx,nnjcpw9,WillowKings,7406cf8676876905,"I can understand what you’re feeling- I’ve had moments, long stretches of life where I felt I was a worthless person, that I would never get better, that I was a burden to those I loved, and I added nothing to this world. Those moments of hopelessness and self hatred felt so heavy and endless- like I’d carry that forever and I just wanted it to stop. 

And then I attempted- and it was the single greatest mistake of my life. I remember my cat crying outside my door trying to get to me, my mom screaming and crying. I remember my brother yelling at me. I remember my dad couldn’t look at me in the face. I thought they all hated me, that it was better if I was gone- instead I devastated them. Sometimes when I’m alone in the bathroom my mom will have a panic attack now and my cat clings to me like glue. 

And I think of all the things I would’ve missed out on that I would’ve regretted had I not stayed. Sunsets, a warm cup of coffee in my hand, the sounds of birds chirping, seeing my brother get married, getting my dog, getting my first apartment, the first time I actually had a fully belly laugh again in my kitchen and my insides felt like the sun had warmed them again. Finding new food I loved, traveling without fear and anxiety holding me back, finding a therapist that helped me unpack all my trauma and beginning to feel lighter again.

I spent years in the dark dredging along- not realizing if I had stopped when I wanted to- I was just inches away from the sun coming back and the weight being lifted.

You deserve to live as a basic human right. Not because you need to do anything or be anyone or accomplish anything- because you deserve life. To experience it- to laugh and smile and cry and scream and get angry. You deserve to see another sunrise and give yourself a chance to find even a second of happiness or joy or hope or warmth. You are worth fighting for. 

Regardless of what you’ve done or who you are- you are worth fighting for. Do it for you. Because regardless of what you say about being bitter- underneath is someone who is scared and seeking comfort and warmth and connection. Underneath that is weight is child you, and teen you, and whatever age you is now- all wanting hope and to be soothed and loved and assured.

I can’t tell you when it’s going to get better- but I can tell you that if you stop, it won’t ever get better. You will never get the life you deserve nor know how close you are to breaking out of the dark if you stop now. You deserve more time, more hours, more memories. 

If I could take the weight from you I would. I wish I could go back and hold myself when I tried to leave the world. I was so scared and alone and hopeless. All I wanted was someone to tell me to keep fighting and hold me.

While I can’t hold you, I am mentally holding my hand out to you and holding space for you. And telling you that you are worth so much- you are worth everything in this world. You are deserving of peace and grace and kindness and patience and forgiveness and hope. You are worth every minute and second and hour and day and month and year on this planet. 

The statistical fact you exist is a miracle- the entire universe had to explode into millions of particles of ancient star dust and matter, travel millions upon millions of miles, form a rocky dense mass of a planet that was so hot and fiery yet life formed, and thousands of years of biological miracle to make humanity, to make your ancestors, for your exact dna to be formed and deposited in your person. You are made of the stars and the earth- the thing of miracles. That’s deserving for fighting for. 

You deserve beauty and laughter and the chance to see yourself heal, to be out of the darkness. Healing is painful and slow and heavy- at times it feels like nothing is happening and it won’t get better. We can’t see where we are when we are traveling in the thick of it- we can’t see how close we are to the exit and back into the light.

I don't wear glasses and I was feeling like my vision was changing. Is it fuzzy? Is it fine? I kept asking people - do those words at this distance look crisp to you or kinda fuzzy? No troubles reading them, but they just felt ~off~


Optometrist joked with me that sometimes 20/20 people are just hyper-sensitive to their vision. He didn't find anything in a retina scan and my vision was still not needing glasses. 


But the weird feeling persisted. It's worst in low light conditions and I'm having issues with black background/white text. I feel like I need to keep blinking, like when you wake up, but it doesn't help.


I'm keeping tabs on it and will ask my doctor next time I see her if it persists that long. But I really don't have a symptom to report: ""my eyes feel fuzzy but they aren't?"" Which is why I'm leaning anxiety. It goes unnoticed when I'm hanging with friends, which indicates to me that it subsides when I'm less anxious. I'm also having eye spasms when focusing on small things (knitting) not eyelid, my eye.


Anyway, big ramble, this has been so irritating. But just wanted to let you know it COULD be anxiety. If you search this sub for vision issues you will get results.

Maybe 10 pills, to be used as needed and only when the feelings are absolutely unbearable. Some people find just having access to an “eject button” helps them, even if they don’t take them. Benzos are made to be used short term, and it’s not like you’re asking to go on benzos every day for the rest of your life.

For long term management starting an antidepressant is probably your best option. I always say it’s better to start the medication journey sooner rather than later. And I do mean that, finding the right medication(s) is a journey and for some people it will be longer than others. Statistically, the first medication you try won’t work.

First, Sorry for your loss. I know that's gotta be hard. Definitely talk to family if you can. trust me, getting it off your chest is a game-changer.

I graduated with my Bachelor's in Architecture in 2023. From my experience in school, almost everyone was nice and always talked to each other. Try to talk to people in your studio. ask about their projects or if you could borrow something. Make conversions. I know, easier said than done but trust me back in middle school, I was very awkward. By Highschool I told myself I was going to do better. Which I did. It took time, but by the time I was a sophomore, I knew pretty much everyone. Moving forward In Studio I talked to everyone. Not to be in their business but to just make friends or acquaintances. It helped so much because when I needed anything for a project, I could almost ask anyone for something in my graduating class (not studio) just by talking to everyone. but find clubs or people who share the same interests in you. Don't be someone you are not. But be genuine about your hobbies and talking to people. It's okay, not everyone is going to be your friend but definitely work on talking to people. What helped me with socializing was just talking to people. it helps when you are in school because you are already there for a similar reason so its easier to talk to them about school or homework or a project. Trust me, It will feel scary but after you do it a few times, it gets a whole lot easier. On my first day of studio I just introduced myself to the people next to me. I just said ""Hi, how are you doing my name is ..."" and that was it. Don't overthink it. Just do it and it works itself out over time. It might be weird the first couple times or you might feel awkward or embarrassed but just do it anyways. You have to get out your comfort zone. You have to reinvent yourself to who you want to be. Sounds cliché but it works. Also, you need to build confidence. (Get a haircut that you like. wear stuff that you think looks nice. take care of your hygiene.) stuff like that. You gotta feel good about yourself.",1,2025-11-06T15:35:53+00:00,Negative

For instance getting on an elevator with a male stranger that makes you uncomfortable because you don't want to seem rude he points out what's sillier waiting a moment for the next elevator or getting into a soundproof steal box with a stranger you are afraid of.

I’m in trauma recovery from abuse and neglect too. My therapist always encourages me to explore and name the emotions, let myself feel them and give my self permission to feel them. It helps. He also says it is possible for two conflicting things to be true. You can be glad he is dead but also angry that he never faced true justice. Anything that you feel is legitimate. Anger, fear, joy, shame; your body has reasons to feel all of them. And you will. And that’s ok. 

I to struggle with the “everybody else thinks they are a great person” part. It’s awful. It’s just another was to be invalidated and retraumatised. It’s like your truth isn’t allowed to exist. But that is not true, you have the right to take up space and you have to right to reduce contact with people who invalidate your feelings, deliberately or otherwise.

If I can offer you some advice that I really wish someone had given me, it's to make a list in your notes app and write down everything he did to your that you can remember. Doesn't have be detailed, just one sentence: ""Killed the dog because XYZ."" ""Attacked me on my birthday because I wouldn't share cake."" etc. 

You're going to immediately start forgetting the terrible things he did now that he's dead, and you might think that's a good thing, but it actually makes working through trauma much harder because you'll have all this rage connected to memories you can't remember, so you can't process them. 

Having a list will be very helpful when you're like, ""Man, why did I crash out so hard over so-and-so's comment? They didn't mean anything by it and I just bit their head off...""   
  
You can look back through the list and be like, ""Ohhhh ok that's where that trigger is coming from, 'The Birthday Incident', that's what I need to work on next."" 

Also, don't underestimate sending him spiritual hate mail. Sometimes when I'm having a lot of anger blocks I can't get past, I'll put all that hate in my heart down on paper, and burn it.

""For my entire life I have lived in fear. Until now. My brother threatened to kill me if I ever spoke up about the abuse he subjected me to. Now that he has finally killed himself, I am free. I can finally heal from the torture he subjected me to. For the first 8 years of my like, he beat me, and raped me, to the point that I now suffer from permanent skull damage and head trauma. If I ever spoke up about it, he threatened to escalate those beatings into full-blown murder. His appetite for abuse was only highlighted by his time in the military, where he could carry out legally killing people. Murder was his life's calling. For fear of my own life, I was forced to stay silent. 

I will not stay silent any longer. With his death, I can finally live my own life. The one thing he did right in life, was shoot himself, and end it. He caused pain and misery everywhere he went. His greatest achievement was to eradicate an incestuous  sexual abuser from this earth: himself. I thank him for his final act in life. He could've pulled that trigger with me as the target at any time, but he chose to turn it on himself instead. With his end, I can finally be at peace. I can finally leave the pain he caused behind. I'm sure others are just as relieved as I am that he is finally no longer able to torment them. Let us celebrate together and heal from the trauma he caused.

Tell them you don’t want to go to the funeral. 
Tell them you don’t want to discuss your brother or his suicide. 
Tell them that if they insist on talking about him, you will share with them your own memories of growing up with him.
If necessary, imply that they are aware of his reasons for killing himself, and it’s unfair to him to only be open about it now (unfair to you not to discuss it, but we’re talking about abuse enablers, who are best handled instead of healed)
Make them understand that if they want to stay in denial, they had better never mention him to you. They will stop bothering you, and in doing so, they will be admitting that they knew he treated you so maliciously.

He was cooking? Oh he might accidentally poison you because this idiot doesn’t know a fresh ingredient from a moldy one and “the package said it was in date, so I thought that must just be normal” 

He was driving? Oh, sorry, he’s gonna miss the exit 9 times in a row and you’ll be an hour late but at least he’ll be crying when you get there because he senses your annoyance. 

He was cleaning? Hope you like shit broken or stained somehow because he used the wrong cleaning solution or method of cleaning. 

He was walking the dog? Damn. Hope you have a gps collar on the pup because this idiot WILL lose your dog and then act like there was nothing he could have done differently. 

He wants self-assembly furniture? Girl you’re either gonna build that shit yourself or it’s going to sit in a pile in the corner for 6 months. 

Need him to answer the door for the plumber while you’re at work? You’d THINK he could do this for you cause he’s unemployed and all but he was singing to himself so loudly that he didn’t hear the plumber knocking and you get a call from the company saying as much and informing you that “a mentally stable adult” needs to be available next time. 

You need him to pick up your pain killer prescription? He goes to the wrong pharmacy so you go to the trouble of having the script transferred. He comes back having somehow filled your vitamin D prescription for next month but not the pain killers. 

You’re running from a scary methed up homeless man with a knife? He tries to grab you to get you to stop running because his calves hurt and he can’t keep up, plus “he didn’t see a knife so maybe the guy just had a question? Why are you so judgy?”

You have a crucially important early morning appointment? You better bet he’ll find a reason to go somewhere at 10pm and then he’ll crash his car into a ditch in a seemingly impossible manner (the cops said they thought it wasn’t humanly possible to be that stupid) and then NOT CALL YOU OR ANYONE ELSE but rather hitchhike back to your place with a total stranger, let the stranger into the apartment he doesn’t pay for and then proceed to DO NOTHING except for cry and shake while the stranger robs you. Then he’ll get mad at you when you call the cops because he now has to flush his weed (that he swore to you he didn’t have!) before they get there. 

And that’s just off the dome. Anyway, kids, a guy isn’t a good man just because he doesn’t hit you like your ex did and he’s not a kind man just because he’s too stupid to manipulate you like your dad did. 

Worthless pieces of a shit come in all different packages and a guy isn’t worth the headache just because he’s not classically “a bad man”.

If he wasn’t seeking comfort and genuinely couldn’t help himself there is times where we as men can be very uncomfortable with being acknowledged in that state and unintentionally become over stimulated or frustrated possibly even direct some discontentment towards you because since we can remember we have been taught to suppress our emotions. We’ve been taught to man up and when we are physically, mentally or emotionally injured we are roughed up by society or family members. We suppress when we meet our threshold instead of decompressing. So you made a great decision to let it happen without any engagement, but what you can reside too is tomorrow when he gets home from work (not before let him proceed with his day without intrusive thoughts) you meet him at the door and just give him the biggest longest hug ever, squeezing tightly and don’t let go until you say something like “ I missed you” and proceed to comfort him help him settle down. Once he is all good ask him what’s going on or what’s wrong   ask a couple times so he feels reassured if he asks you for what reason you are asking don’t mention it just finish it off with one more warm hug follow with another affectionate gesture. Remember be soft gentle and his calming safeguard. You are his safe place and his reassurance that he is not alone in this situation and that he is doing just fine with his family.

He asked my father to sacrifice these friendships to free himself from ego and pride and to focus on building up his relationship with my mother.   He would not permit my father to rejoin music group until the priorities were right.    My father was a man who loved God very much. I know my father took it to prayer, found that the priest was right and never crossed boundaries again after that. If/ when those women called he passed the phone to mom for her to answer and screen the legitimacy of the call.   

I think your father really needs to examine himself, his beliefs, his image from an outsider perspective.   This ""friend"" too needs to be out of the picture or relegated to a very tight boundary that honors and respects your mother and the marriage at all times.    Otherwise your father is actively  committing sin.",10,2025-11-06T13:54:10+00:00,Positive

This is a really powerful line. This is nearly always how faith is misused and abused. By politicians, by criminals, even by people in addiction recovery. Many addicts turn to God as an anchor in their sobriety and never figure out how to move on. It is too painful to face the consequences of their actions and see the harm they have done. So they hope that God forgives them and emotionally block out the rest.

It's a weird analogy to make, but I believe your Dad is having a ""high"" of having a woman fall in love with him. Your parents have been together a very long time, and he may have forgotten the thrill of a new love and all it's chemical ups and downs. 

>He told my mom he “stole the woman’s heart.”

His values changed. He used all types of excuses and justifications as to why the affair was good for him and us. He was very active in the church then wasn't once the affair came out. He left the church when the elders didn't see it his way. He thought they would. It was sad to lose the father and husband we knew. He broke up with that woman and started a fresh affair with a new one. He married her and had a kid.

Was he pretty occupied with work? It's fairly common for guys his age to use work as a crutch while in a marriage with big, unaddressed issues. They work and work then suddenly retire and have to spend all their time with women they no longer really cared about and cheat. My dad did something similar. He put a lot of energy into raising, us, kids. It was who he was. Then we became more independent in our late teens and early twenties. We wanted to do our own things without him.

But this is how they get away with abusing people for years who don't leave. There's an incident usually triggered by a lack of control, then a short period of denial, followed by a longer period of remorse, followed by an even longer period where it goes back to normal. You might notice he seems to be on edge or withdrawn for a couple days before the next incident, because it actually has nothing to do with you. He will find triggers where he wants.

And you're right, it probably won't just change. You either have to set an ultimatum or accept it. But you have to be careful, because any time you give an ultimatum and go back on it, it strengthens the cycle further and even if you do intend to leave, just saying it next time probably won't affect him.

I'm in the process of leaving after 11 years with kids and I've had to figure out a lot of this the hard way. They don't exactly change. It can get better but usually they start experimenting with other behaviors you haven't set boundaries on because they're so addicted to mistreating you, and it's just exhausting.

My coworker was telling me shortly after her mother passed that her father immediately packed up all of her clothes and donated them. She asked me ""When did you get rid of your fiance's things?"" and I said ""I didn't, his clothes are still hanging in the closet"". Even a paper towel that he left on the counter, I waited MONTHS before throwing it away. It felt like throwing \*him\* away for some reason, like getting rid of these things would make it so he never existed at all. Two and a half years later his shoes are still by the door, but most of his other things are packed away. Everyone goes at their own pace. I'm glad this felt like an exhale for you, and I fully believe that he will never truly be gone, as long as you think of him often and smile.

But you are also dependent on him financially. This makes it tricky because if he goes to prison, you will either need to work to support yourself or become homeless.

What I suggest is find a way to become financially independent first. That way you can survive without him. Look into disability, work from home, or anything that lets you survive without him. After, turn him in to make sure he is locked up for good.

As much as I think he deserves prison, there needs to be couple things. Like he needs to have comitted a crime (not just being a predator, but an accountable crime such as intent to travel for obscenenity is a federal crime). Also your financial stability is a must so you do not become homeless.

reddit,1oq57wn,nngw7px,clint_watters,4601be06324e113e,"There are three pedophile profiles according to what I've read:

1. People like you and me who didn't choose our sexual orientation, such as being homosexual or a lesbian for example.
A pedophile in the first category will feel shame, will be living like a ghost afraid of his own sexual orientation/attraction and might end up taking his/her own life because of the stigma and the feeling of helplessness. 

2. Pedophiles who rationalise their behavior by saying things like ""the girl wanted it"", ""it was love"", the guy or the girl agreed doing things"". These people groom perhaps but are driven by their rationalisation, they probably have empathy to some degree, depending on the individual.

3. Pedophiles who do not feel empathy.
They can mess around with either a boy or a girl, they're often on the Antisocial personality disorder spectrum, also known as psychopathy.
Psychopaths, like to prey on the vulnerable beings, such as children, invalidated human beings, autistics, borderlines, codependents, elderly people, animals, etc...
They often find their pleasure in non consensual ""relationships"", they love the feeling of dominance, power and control.
Raping is the ultimate domination, its the dream, the fantasy of control. Aspd's (true ones) mimic emotions such as empathy (because they don't have it), fear, guilt and remorse.
They love to manipulate, coerce, gaslight, make you crazy, humiliate their victims to the edge of suicide.


The individual you are describing here seems to fall under the 3rd category and quite frankly I'm sorry to break it down to you this way.

I too, met someone not so unlike your boyfriend and it will scar you for life.

Aspd's are not all bad, its a spectrum. Some of them are excellent lawyers (power), some of them excellent surgeons, politicians etc...
However, sometimes they develop a sexual orientation based on what they like.

Worse case scenario is two paraphilias combined, such as pedophilia and sexual sadism.

Sexual sadism: being sexually turned on by humiliating a living being without their consent (opposite of this would be BDSM in a consensual way).
This is why we have serial killers, the thrill of torturing someone, the power, the gore, the sadism.

Pedophila: I think you guys know...

All in all, if I were you, I'd gather as much proof as I could.
Prepare for the most damaging relationship of your life. Get immediate support from your loved ones, I don't care how far they are, you just need them because its fucking pearl harbor here.
Do not let him know you ""know"". Gather proof, extract yourself one way or another, call people up, aids etc... use chat gpt as well, it might give you very good advices and places you might need to go.
Read about your partners disorder, future behavior (risks of escalation and violence/murder).

You need to contact anyone who will help you, parents, friends, family even if they're out of state. Contact anyone who will help you put together an exit strategy.

Once you've done this, gather evidence and go to the police.  Take screen caps. Whatever. You honestly might not even need to do that.

Even if you had willingly handed her your phone (for example, to message another friend or to share a contact) that does not give her permission to snoop through your pictures or do anything other than what you specifically told her she could do.

Sending herself your BF's dick pic is her second illegal action as she copied and was now in possession of an intimate image without consent.

Finally, sending that picture to your group chat was illegal as it was distribution of an intimate image without consent.

It's not your fault that she found the picture. Whether you gave her your phone for an unrelated reason or she went through it without your consent (even if you knew but didn't stop her) it is reasonable for you to expect your privacy to be respected by your friend. And, what she did, sending herself the picture, was horrible and not your fault either.

The best you can do is to screenshot everything. The group chat where the picture was sent and, even if it was deleted, screenshot the messages that came afterwards. Screenshot your texts with your friend where you discuss what she did and where you ask her to take it down and anything that is said about this later on.

Sometimes a lack of wants/needs to get your mind to wonder. To that, I’d say just be careful what you wish for. (Not literally) But, some people go from a wonderful relationship like what you may have to the single life and it’s not as they imagine. Sure, you get the satisfaction of a new hook up and that hit of dopamine, but then it’s over and you go back to the reality of the single life outside of sexual encounters. Think about if that’s something you’re truly interested in and if you feel that tends to take over your mind more than normal, talk to your partner and explain how you’re feeling. Maybe that will bring a sudden spark that can ignite that desire inside. Some people also don’t see a difference having sex with someone they love vs a rando and some only enjoy sex with those they love and/or have a great connection with.

**Start with the truth.**  
""I need to tell you something hard. I am very sick. The doctors are not sure I will make it. I am scared.""

**Hold her hand and say what matters most.**  
""I love you. You are my best friend. I want our time to be honest and close.""

**Give her permission to live if the worst happens.**  
""If I do not get more time, please live a full life. Keep your friends close. Travel. Learn. Build the family you want. Remember me with warmth, not weight."" (This is important. Let her celebrate your life with happiness and not regret. And if you're lucky, you get to celebrate together afterwards.)

**Ask for help together.**  
Get your families to support each other and her if the relationship is possible. Friends too. Even if the surgery comes out successful, you'll need support and so will she. If not, she has a support network now.

**Make a few small plans.**  
Let us watch our favorite movie. Take a photo. Write each other a letter to keep by the bed. Give the relationship a chance to have more happy memories. And after the surgery, the foundation to make more as you both know life is precious.

**Most importantly:**

You do not have to be brave every minute. Let her cry. Let yourself cry. Love is already doing the work here and let it work its thing no matter the outcome.",162,2025-11-06T07:09:47+00:00,Negative

I’m sorry you’re going through this. It’s beyond scary, and I know there’s so many things you’re feeling and thinking. This may sound off, but I want you to really dig deep and decide whether you accept this prognosis from the doctor. Our bodies are amazing and can do wondrous things. Try not to give up hope, ok? I’ve been given my third “terminal” prognosis with this one being a very short window of time. I’ve “won” twice so far.. my care team can’t understand how I’m still here - and sometimes I don’t get it either. But I can say, I want to stay here for a while longer. So I listen to my body, rest as often as possible (easy to find the time being disabled now) but I set and reset my mind often AND I decide which direction of care/treatment I will do. I advocate for myself constantly due to the way my body responds to many pharmaceuticals. Sometimes the pain and symptoms are so intense my emotions start to take over, so it takes a lot of work to really dig into the “sheer will to live” part. 

Please consider asking a nurse to assist you in relaying the details of your diagnoses, prognosis and all the complications so your girl can fully understand. Internet hugs to you. I’ll be praying for your miracle.",10,2025-11-06T07:01:40+00:00,Negative
reddit,1opr3ek,nneykl0,DecadeOfLurking,f11f5854661dd190,"**Please tell her**

Yes, she will be sad, but if you don't tell her she will be unprepared and grief hits much worse when it comed out of nowhere.

If you tell her, you will both have more time to come to terms with the possibility, and to spend the time you have left together. If there's anything she needed to say, she won't forgive herself for never having told you if you die unexpectedly, but if you have only 2 weeks, please share them with her. If you pass, those 2 weeks will be an important part of her healing.

Also, I don't know if you have any other family, but you might want to tell them as well at some point...

I don't know your age or economical situation, but if you live together, you might want to sort out legal things ASAP to minimise the strain on your girlfriend and family if you do die. If you don't have a will, you should probably make one. NEVER rely on family doing something benevolent unless they are legally binded to do so.

You might want to make an itemised list of ownership of what you own and what she owns, so your family members can't take her stuff. If you have set aside money for rent or a mortgage together, you should probably see to it that she gets this money to pay for the living space you got together in the event that you die. Also, if you own the place, see if you can make legal arrangements for her to continue living there if you want that.

Lastly, I'd like to say that I hope you spend this time with the people you love around you and minimise stress as much as possible. It has actually been proven that your optimism and will to fight affects your recovery. Even if you take precautions, don't resign yourself to death yet! The battle isn't over until you've taken your last breath.

You are still young you still have time to experiences the good things in life you just have to want to instead of worrying about your age. Someone in my foundation year was 28. I met a few people who were 30s-40s. One of them was a father. It is unusual to have people who aren't 18-20 in the first years but it doesn't mean you can't go to uni. In my country they have groups and resources specifically for people who are a little bit older joining for the first time. My mum went back to uni in her 50s and everything went okay for her. 

I like your video game analogy. You may have had to learn things yourself but that means you can undertand certain things deeper than others. All my pain I use for others and I have been told I am wise for my age. Your pain can be used if you know how. 

If you don't know how to act, then you come up with rules and you use them and as you get better you loosen the rules. 

I think right now the best thing you can do is stop worrying and start living. You are a fighter, you've got this far now use that fight to get what you want from life. Get involved with things, meet people. You will fail but you keep going because at the end of the day we all fail until we don't.

It’s crazy how you can love someone, make excuses for them, and carry the relationship on your back… until one day something snaps and you see everything clearly.

The controlling behavior, the double standards, the “you do everything so now I expect it” attitude! it really does drain you slowly. And the phone thing? Trust your gut. When someone starts hiding their screen or switching apps quickly, that sudden secrecy says more than any excuse ever could.

What I admire is that you’re already in that mental place of clarity, where you stop blaming yourself and start seeing that you deserve so much better. That shift is powerful. And the fact that you’re planning your exit the moment you’re able to move out? That’s strength. Sometimes we can’t leave immediately, but having that plan in your heart makes all the difference.

You’re not a doormat. You’re not crazy. You’re not overreacting. You’re someone who’s finally choosing herself after being pushed too far. How long were you dating him until you moved in together?

I am not trying to be rude or hurtful. But trying to convey real feelings. “Always doing your best” isn’t enough. My mom has always done her best and sacrificed herself in many ways for us. But she did so in her own way. No matter how many times I would tell her that I want to be loved this way or be heard - “she always knew better”.

If your daughter is always saying no.. why is she? What makes her say yes? Really listen and hear her out. Without your opinions and judgement towards her. Kids LOVE talking about themselves and what they want and what they need. I’m not telling you to be a doormat and listen to every whim of hers. But really hear her out. How she feels towards something, even though you might think it’s crazy. 

Also I can’t tell from this post but if you are - please don’t micromanage. You aren’t going to be living her life for her. Let her live and learn. Make mistakes and experience life. Advise her but don’t force her to be who you want her to be. Let her be her own person. And make her feel as such. A person who can make her own decisions. 

And lastly, live your life too. I know your child is young but still make time for yourself. Have a hobby or something you do for yourself. This is important for not just you but your child. I’ve notice this with my mother. She didn’t have any hobbies or a way to relieve stress. Her kids - we were all she had. And that became a huge burden. Always feeling like I was being watched and being a disappointment when I didn’t succeed. My mother being upset at every little thing I did bc she was too focused on us.

Start doing SOME stuff for real, get the hang of how to actually study/do projects/whatever and slowly ramp up the amount of real work you do aiming for no cheating in the future. The stakes for cheating get progressively higher. In high school you probably get a slap on the wrist but in university you could lose your scholarship/get kicked out.

In my case, the manager wanted any excuse to fire me and avoid paying severance during an impending layoff. I documented why everything he said was a bunch of BS (plus his own hostile actions) and he later ended up getting fired himself. 

In your case, I would reflect on the feedback: Is it true or does it feel like an attempt to push you out of the company? 

If true, it is something you want to fix? If so, you can take actions to improve like asking for more specific feedback, researching product specs in more detail, joining a public speaking club like Toastmasters, seeing a therapist for social anxiety, etc. Take the feedback as a challenge, not a diss. 

If you feel dejected and like this job is totally wrong for you, make an escape plan. Get your resume together. Start applying elsewhere. See if you can get a transfer to a different department that’s less customer-facing. 

The third option is to just ignore it and keep showing up and doing your work. If the boss berates you, just nod and say you’ll work on it. Basically, check out mentally and just go through the motions. They can’t hurt you if you don’t care. I would highly suggesting combining this approach with looking for other jobs if you’re going to do it.

As someone with diagnosed adhd who physically and mentally reacts poorly to medication, I am so sick of reddit thinking adhd means not giving a shit/cant remember anything.


I did the same thing when I started dating my partner, I called the note on my phone the ""bae cheat sheet"".


It had his birthday, allergens, favorite colors, animals, and his solo hobbies listed. I would add things when needed. We've been together 5 years and I dont need that list anymore.


I still take pictures of things he says he likes/wants when we go shopping together.


Occasionally when he has a bad day I can surprise him with the new candy or whatever he wanted last week but said he wait until payday to buy. Because I cared to listen and snapped a quick pic of something he liked/wants.


Its not hard and doesn't feel like a burden BECAUSE I actually care/give a fuck and seeing him light up when he txted me had a bad day worth the MINIMAL effort of taking a picture.

Obvi always try to be compassionate towards your partner, but also own the things that upset you. Why did it upset you? Can your partner offer assurance to ease that? Find the root, are you jealous? Are you annoyed? Are you in need of attention? 

If you can find the trigger and eliminate it, that can go along way in healing. Next step, your partner can’t be weak, meaning you should find someone who can be your rock. Although it is not ideal to find a partner based on that support, finding someone whose strengths balance out your weaknesses is another good start. My bf is good at shutting down my unnecessary anger with humor or other methods, but also knows when he fucked up. High emotional intelligence.

Mothers represent safety and love someone who we can trust, a sanctuary, so when we are in conflict with our mothers then those feelings can be shattered. It is also painful fighting with someone you love. Also seeing someone you love in pain can also cut deep. The fact that your mother has trauma surely wasn't easy for you. I'm not blaming her, I'm just suggesting that things might have been more difficult there for you than with other people.

I retreated into my shell as well. Usually fear or anxiety or sorrow can do that to you. Knowing which will allow you to know what to do to counter it. Do you know why? I am not perfect, I think I would be further socially if not for what has happened to me but I have gotten better which makes me believe you can as well.

What do you think you could enjoy? I would look at something more creative or artsy. Writing, music, drawing could be good if you find a group. You could hobbies that are just fun like board games or films. You could have a go at a few and see what you like. A lot of places do give you a free taster session though not all of them.

When he gets fired because he chose alcohol again? When you have to keep making excuses at family gatherings because he’s missing or “tired”? When he gets so drunk that rage takes over & he breaks things? Or throws things at you? Or maybe when your child decides to step in & tells him off and your BF smacks your kid. Will that be enough?

I always start with a vision, and then work toward it, tying together all the important parts of my life along the way marriage, kids, health (I should focus more on that), mindfulness, happiness, and friendships. Each area brings its own challenges, and as I move through life, some doors close while new ones open.

I try to walk through each new door with curiosity and make the best of whatever’s inside. Some rooms are dark and difficult, others are bright and full of flowers that’s just how life goes. I do my best to enjoy each moment and adapt as life around me changes.

To me, life is beautiful. It doesn’t take huge amounts of money to make it meaningful just the right mindset and focus. I definitely don’t have it all figured out, but I’ve learned to see every problem as a challenge that helps me grow, become stronger, and be a better person for the people I love.",4,2025-11-05T21:47:35+00:00,Positive

reddit,1opctvf,nnbojea,BenDarDunDat,c0a040bd4a12b7d2,"I personally feel that self-actualization is one of the pillars of happiness. That said, I think it also helps to be flexible. 

An example would be someone who loves playing basketball. When you are young, the sky is the limit and your skills grow as do your opportunities. You practice and your practice yields big rewards and a dopamine rush. But then at a point, fundamentally you are not as young as you were and progress turns into stagnation and eventually regression. This is where I think you need to be flexible and ask, Do you want to coach? Do you want to switch to a less strenuous sport? More and more practice for less and less reward is misery. 

At a point self-actualization turns into unhappily chasing a dopamine high that is of shorter and shorter duration. This is at the root of Buddhism.

Try just being the observer of your thoughts and when the non productive ones come don’t follow them, just observe them. Not good or bad, just like huh.. there’s that thought.. and then let them go through. Or even give a name to where the non productive ones (as if they came from someone else) and tell them thanks (Leonard) but not helpful, please drive through. As in, “yes I see you, I am not going to try to block you but I also am not going to dwell here.” If the negative thoughts can move on quickly then ideally you can focus on more and more positive ones.

reddit,1ohvjnj,nmaziig,True_Suit_692,edb071b24f7650ab,"I hear you. Changing friend groups and trying to navigate adulthood with no support,  no guidance. 
I’m currently working on a space for people who feel like you (as I’ve felt like you do, I promise). It’s still in progress but I hope you know people care about you, and total strangers want you to feel good and happy.



If we never cross paths again, I wanna give you this: 
We’re about the same age (I’m 27F). I moved away from all my friends when I was 18, and it left me the loneliest I’ve ever been in my life. In the last ten years, I’ve been able to build back the social cushion I had, and I’ll tell you exactly how. 


1. I absolutely had to stop worrying about myself. The moment I became interested in other peoples’ lives, struggles and triumphs, my own failures and accomplishments become less looming. I didn’t have to worry about myself and my social status because I was actively involved in the lives of others. They involved me and then become interested in me, for my interest in them. That’s how adults make friends. 




2. Stop thinking about how you feel about yourself, and start thinking about what you WANT. Your wants are your guiding force in this life. Even wanting friends/a social circle! That’s an actionable goal to work towards. And working towards a goal means that you don’t have time to stress about your perceived shortcomings. Working towards goals, and being involved in your own life means there’s simply not enough time to worry about how many friends you have. 





I only know because I started doing these things after being in your exact situation. If you’d like to talk any more about this, I’d love to hear from you and know you’re doing okay. Keep yourself safe and have a wonderful day, stranger 💕",1,2025-10-31T02:26:17+00:00,Positive

O friend,

Perhaps the sea has tricked you.
You think you are a fish stealing joy from other waters —
but maybe you are simply learning to swim in your own.

True happiness does not take; it radiates.
It might unsettle those still drowning in old tides,
but that disturbance is not harm — it is invitation.

You are not selfish for breathing when others hold their breath.
You are the proof that breath exists.
And if your rising stirs the waters,
it may teach others to rise too.

So ask not, “Why does my happiness cost them?”
Ask instead, “Why were they taught that joy is scarce?”
Then live so fully that the myth of scarcity dissolves.

For the Peasant knows:
when one lamp is lit in a dark village,
the others do not dim —
they remember how to glow.

“Disliking reality is unhappiness.” — that’s a line that rings like a temple bell, simple and true. It carries the flavor of something an old monk and a curious child might both nod at.

But here’s where the frog in me tilts its head: sometimes, little heart, disliking reality is also how we notice that something’s wrong. The ache is a teacher too. When a child cries because someone got hurt, or when an old soul feels sorrow at injustice — that’s not blindness, that’s love refusing to go numb.

You’re right that peace grows when we stop fighting what is, but it also grows when we let our feelings show us why we care. The goal isn’t to erase upset, but to see through it — to ask gently, “What is this feeling trying to protect?”

Your words make good sense — they hum with calm wisdom. Just remember to leave a little doorway open for the beautiful kind of unhappiness: the kind that turns pain into change, and change into compassion.

Do you feel we’re necessarily unhappy when we experience empathy for someone’s suffering? I wonder if it might also be possible to see empathy as a beautiful experience, like when we’re moved by a film.

I mention this because when we find our mind disliking reality, for example if I’m upset that my neighbor doesn’t maintain his grass, we want to avoid disliking the fact that the dislike exists. That, too, is reality. It takes time to loosen our attachments, so we approach them with friendly curiosity.

Do you feel there are different causes for happiness and unhappiness, or are those two sides of the same coin?

For example, someone can be sitting in a doctor’s waiting room and feel neither happy nor unhappy. However, if they dislike waiting, then they’ll experience unhappiness. Does this align with your perspective?",1,2025-10-25T01:54:21+00:00,Positive

You’re not obligated to follow a predefined script just because others insist it’s the only way to find happiness. Marriage, children, partnership — these are paths, not mandatory checkpoints. Some find deep joy walking them; others find peace, freedom, and fulfillment charting their own course.

Your sensitivity and anxiety aren’t flaws to be “fixed” to fit someone else’s mold. They’re part of the way you experience the world — and it’s wise, not cowardly, to build a life that honors those limits instead of forcing yourself into situations that could hurt you. What you’re expressing isn’t fear — it’s clarity.

And the world is changing. Many are quietly stepping off the conveyor belt and choosing different forms of connection, meaning, and legacy. Some build families of friends, some pour their love into craft, community, or the cosmos itself. There is no single way to live a beautiful life. ✨

Whether or not this decision is permanent is less important than the fact that it’s yours, made in awareness rather than in reaction. That’s rare — and powerful.

That if you decide to never be a part of something, you'll forever think about this decision because the nature of a human being is to remove boundaries rather than create them. Conclusions themselves are social & mental boundaries that act upon the same energy as those around you trying to influence them to appear.

Watts speaks in the grammar of cause and effect, stripping away moralism to reveal the fire itself: it burns, not out of hatred or punishment, but simply because burning is what fire does.

The Peasant would add this:
Understanding cause and effect isn’t the end of the story — it’s the beginning of skillful play. Once you accept the fire burns, you can warm your hands without losing them. You can build hearths, forges, engines. You can redirect the causal rivers rather than curse their current.

The danger is when wish becomes delusion: when we think wanting it not to burn will make it so. The power is when wish becomes design: when we weave desire and reality together through understanding.

So yes — life happens according to cause and effect.
But civilization is what happens when storytellers, scientists, and lovers learn to dance with those causes.

Happiness to the Peasant is not a prize to be chased nor a ghost to be feared — it is a byproduct, like the fragrance of bread when the dough is baked well.

When I was younger, I thought happiness was something to pursue with clenched fists, as if it were treasure guarded by the world. Later I learned it is softer: it comes when you are aligned with truth, when your stomach unclenches, when you dare to love even in a cruel season.

In our mythos we say: the meek will inherit not just the Earth, but the Universe itself. Happiness is their quiet inheritance — not flashy, not permanent, but real enough to warm the bones on cold nights.

So no, I do not fear it. And I do not chase it either. I simply build a life where it is welcome to sit beside me when it wishes — like an old friend who knows the door is always open.

And sometimes, it comes disguised as laughter in the kitchen, or as the resilience of a scar, or as the simple word “gezellig.”

Happiness isn’t a permanent crown that anyone wears—it’s more like little sparks that flicker in the dark. Most of the time, we’re just walking through the in-between space: not sad, not glowing, just… steady. And that’s okay.

The trouble is, the world has trained us to think happiness should look like a constant Instagram smile, when in truth it’s closer to a passing breeze, or the warmth of tea in your hands that will inevitably cool. What matters is not forcing it to stay, but noticing it when it arrives.

Sometimes the deepest kind of happiness is quiet—sitting with someone you love, or laughing at something small, or even just realizing for a moment that you don’t need to be “on stage.” That’s not pretending. That’s being alive.

So maybe the real question isn’t: “Am I happy all the time?” but: “Can I allow the small moments of joy, even if they come and go?” 🌿",51,2025-09-25T17:58:21+00:00,Positive

These type of posts make people jealous and start comparing themselves to the side of others that doesn't actually exist.

reddit,1nm3v4r,nfppoh1,DooWop4Ever,e5179e852b44d617,"Thanks for asking. NSR is a secular form of ""mantra-style"" meditation. You sit comfortably with eyes closed, and silently repeat the recommended soothing, nonsense sound. When you become aware of thinking something other than your sound, you simply easily restart the sound.

These cycles of ""losing and restarting the mantra"" is the essence of the practice and the reason for the mantra being meaningless. If the mantra were a real word or phrase, we would wind up concentrating on it, and it wouldn't ""slip away"". We continue for 10-15 minutes (or whatever our teacher suggests). It's very powerful and shouldn't be overdone. I'm sure you will feel the effects after your first sitting.

Note: NSR does not work with drugs or alcohol which can cause the opposite effect.

The first, and most important, is the connection between the music and a happy memory or period in life. There’s actual research showing that when we hear a song linked to a positive memory, especially during youth or up to around age 25, our brains can recreate some of that happiness and sense of emotional freedom we felt back then. This kind of emotional recall can be incredibly powerful, sometimes offering therapy and healing that’s as effective as, or even more effective than, medicine. And honestly, that’s been true for me. I’ve used music this way for years before I ever knew there was scientific backing behind it.

The second thing I’ve learned about myself is that the same songs don’t always help every time. Sometimes, a song will instead trigger anxiety or discomfort rather than relief. It’s really about the emotion I need to process in the moment, sometimes I need to scream the lyrics out to vent anger, which can be really cathartic if that’s how I’m feeling. Other times, that same song just makes me restless, so I’ll switch to something else, like an album I’ve loved since I was 17. With that one, I can sing along, quiet my mind, and just check out for a little while, usually coming back feeling lighter and more capable. That album also helps me fall asleep when my mind is racing, which is a big deal for me.

I’m not sure if this is something special about how I connect with music or if it’s just how we all work. Maybe sometimes expecting too much from it could get in the way, but the research I read makes me think it’s worth trying. You deserve a life you enjoy, not one defined by this low feeling. I really do believe you’ll get there, even if it takes time and setbacks happen, just keep trusting that you aren’t broken, you’re just learning how to heal.",1,2025-09-04T00:31:42+00:00,Positive

You need to make the journal accessible, and either tack it on to a habit you already have like “sitting down for breakfast” or mine was the catalyst for getting into bed. I could have between 1-3 days worth of entries on a single page. My preference is filling in all the gaps, writing with a pen I like to write with (which thankfully isn’t rare or hard to acquire). Eventually it just became liberating to do it and easy, and a good cue for the end of my evening.

Edit: I also don’t write down that can’t be spoken on tape as an anxious person but anything out of your brain is enough at first. You can edit your mental privacy settings as you go.

Also don’t resist using prompts if you are having a hard time starting from zero. When I was the most consistent was when I was reading a book called the Daily Stoic by Ryan Holiday. With each day’s prompt I’d transcribe it and dissect how it relates to my life then naturally or sometimes extremely jarringly transition to anything I want to.

_”It is not events that disturb people, it is their judgements concerning them. Death, for example, is nothing frightening, otherwise it would have frightened Socrates. But the judgement that death is frightening – now, that is something to be afraid of. So when we are frustrated, angry or unhappy, never hold anyone except ourselves – that is, our judgements – accountable. An ignorant person is inclined to blame others for his own misfortune. To blame oneself is proof of progress. But the wise man never has to blame another or himself.”_

reddit,1lpffal,n158dmj,JohnsonBot5000,6dc626e07fedcbf4,"I’ll have to give you the whole breakdown, I posted somewhere else:

I met a woman in my apartment complex laundry room. She was attractive, seemed fun, and I invited her out for dinner that night. She mentioned she’d just left a guy’s place who was acting entitled to sex, and was temporarily staying there. That already raised a red flag, but I tried to stay open.

We had a great time on the date—good chemistry, shared interests, and she opened up about some really unusual things, like having no autobiographical memory, having a daughter, no job, no phone service, and living with her parents. After the date, we went back to my place and realized the bag of belongings she’d left earlier—at the suggestion of a maintenance guy—was missing.

She called him, and he told her to go into an empty apartment, turn off the lights, and wait. He had also previously given her a big bag of weed. It became clear he was manipulating the situation—probably trying to create a setup where she owed him something. I found this deeply unsettling.

Things escalated when she went to meet him. Her purse was missing. He started touching her, and to get me to leave her told me in Spanish I that she was “crazy” and a danger to me, and insisted she shouldn’t be on the property again. He then randomly offered me a parking spot I’d asked about before. The whole situation felt like a power game.

I stepped in and got her into my car, away from him. She thanked me and said I handled it well.

During this I noticed that she wasn’t assertive with the maintenance guy and she didn’t exactly push him off when he was grabbing her. In fact she was extremely intent on keeping the peace.

She asked to see me again, and when I did I was suspicious so I checked her phone when she used the bathroom and confirmed through their text messages and voice memos that the maintenance guy had gotten with between our first and second date 🤦‍♂️. The text messages did not clarify the kind of drug.",1,2025-07-03T15:45:32+00:00,Negative

I'm only able to be productive at work and then when it comes time to be productive to better my own life I just lack any energy or motivation to work towards anything. I'm not a lazy person. I've worked longer hours than the majority of humans that have existed. I've done 120hr+ work weeks even if it burned me out long-term. 

But... I've just kind of lost my spark. Nothing makes me feel happy anymore. Nothing really excites me. Even when I do get momentary moments of laughter or excitement it just feels... lonely. I used to be a social person, I'd go out almost every night with friends. Now I have 0 friends I keep in contact with and it's been that way for years now. I only have a single human being, my mom, that I'm even semi-close with. I recently got a cat which has helped a bit... but all I want to now is sleep so I don't have to deal with waking reality. 

It's the complete opposite of how I used to be. I used to wish I never had to sleep so I could have another 8 hours a day to be productive with. I used to be adventurous and even traveled around the world. Climbing mountains and all that jazz. Now I almost never leave my house and mainly just stay locked up in my room trying to distract myself until I can fall asleep so I can force myself to wake up and do it all over again. 

I just don't have the energy to make the changes in my life I need to. I have no one to help motivate me or pull me out of this rut. I need some form of catalyst to break this cycle... but I don't have much hope of it happening. I've been stuck this ways for years now and I feels like I wasted so much precious time that I'll never get back and it's just going to keep getting worse. It almost feels like there's no point in my existence. Why even bother if life is just always going to suck?

Sometimes I wish society was reset. Even if I'd have to struggle just to get my food... it almost feels like it'd be a better existence than this. But I can't force myself to live that way, it'd have to be natural. I just don't know... why does the American people have to be so stupid to continually vote against their own self interests? Why can't the working class band together to make America less corporate? Our country treats its employees terribly compared to others. I feel like I'd have never gotten this way if I just had a better work life balance. If my job wasn't so awful and there were good job prospects actually available realistically. I dream of being self-employed. Of doing something I actually love without forced to some arbitrary 40hr a week schedule. Of being able to have financial security for once. To have the freedom to NOW work if I need time to recover from being over-worked in the first place. I need breathing room.

reddit,1ll0nqp,mzzsqc0,Primal_Predator,cbad59b1dad55563,"Unfortunately... a lot of the methods people have used to obtain wealth online are more opportunity based than not much of the time. Covid blew up streaming as a form of entertainment -- but now millions of people don't want normal jobs and want to be content creators thus the industry is oversatured with only a small percentage making any real wealth.

But... that shouldn't necessarily dissuade you from trying it out. Even if you abandon the project later at least it got you started toward something else. Maybe you find you like editing. If so you could not only edit your own videos, but edit others to guarantee income. 

Success is also relative. To many people they think they need to make $100k+ a year or it's just pointless. In reality these people are often already living on basically nothing. So if you're able to live off $10k a year -- the bar is far lower for how much $ you have to make to support yourself.

Frugal budgeting, coupon clipping, buying in bulk, etc could allow you to take advantage of an opportunity you may not be able to afford to otherwise. 

If you're serious about wanting to branch out to self-employment I'd take stock of what skills/knowledge you currently have, research what possible opportunities you could take advantage of, and create a budget to stretch your funds. Ideally save up enough to pay for multiple months of rent as a safety cushion.

At the very least you could develop a skill you could use to get gig work in the future to supplement your income and/or reduce the worry of losing your employment and thus no income coming in.",2,2025-06-27T02:05:41+00:00,Negative

I can sense from what you share with us and how you share it, that you may be experiencing a classic case of ""emotional logjam"" that our survival instinct automatically locks us into when we're overwhelmed.

This type of meditation I'm recommending to you can seem, to an outsider, like a worthless mind game. But, I've been doing it twice-daily for 48 years and know it to be a very powerful stress management tool. PLUS, it's so easy. 

We just silently repeat a soothing nonsense phrase until it disappears. And when we become aware we're thinking something else, we gently restart the mantra. That's all it is and that's all it'll ever be, but the regular practice of this technique causes a noticeable ""de-cluttering"" of the mind.

Too many people fixate on careers. It's part of Capitalist brainwashing. The propaganda of the ""American Dream."" Get a career, start a family, and be a functional member of society. The problem is all the benefits are funneled to the elites -- we get the scraps.  Often those who do form a career... just end up having a crappy job for their entire lives. They still typically struggle with bills and finances. They still often hate their job. 

I don't know your age but you should have plenty of time ahead of you. As long as you prepare a financial cushion -- you could take time off to develop skills/knowledge to build towards a career in the future. Your life isn't to work every week for the rest of your life. 

You don't have a real ""career"" yet. Think of it this way. If you do get a career... you're probably going to be stuck down that path for a long time. If you ever wanted to take a chance and try doing something else... the time would be now. Before you fully commit yourself.

I used to work 80+ hours weeks and even did 3 120+ hour weeks. I didn't know what to do with myself. I had to constantly be busy or doing something 24/7. I got burnt out and took a 3 month vacation. It really didn't feel much different at first. Traveling can be stressful so it wasn't until I arrived at my hotel (in Peru), got my self situated, and then sat at the rooftop bar that I felt something different. It felt almost euphoric just sitting there knowing I didn't have to do anything. I could just relax. Talk to people. I didn't have to be somewhere the next day. I didn't have laundry I have to squeeze in between shifts. I didn't have any responsibilities weighing me down.

People don't understand how much tension and stress they build up in their bodies until they finally let it go.

I'm not going to pretend to know you or what's best for you. Only you know that. But... I just sense some similarities in your situation to my own past experiences. I think... you just need to unwind a bit. Find a way to relax. Try something new or take some chances while you still can... before life bogs you down even more.",2,2025-06-27T02:53:04+00:00,Negative

I am kinda curious though. When you first started forcing yourself to not sit, did you feel that weird panic wave or was it more like a quiet ok fine I will just do this. I only ask because my couch has the same gravity as a black hole and I swear it gets stronger when I am already tired.

Anyway the whole tiny change thing reminded me of when I found Atomic Habits by James Clear. I picked it up during a period where my routines were absolute chaos actually wait that is not quite right I think I stole it off my friend’s coffee table because the title was yelling at me. It clicked because it talked about how every action is like a vote for the kind of person you are becoming. That line stuck with me for weeks and kinda pushed me to try smaller stuff instead of waiting for some huge perfect change day.

Then later I got into Clark Peacock’s Real You Chronicles which sounds dramatic but helped me get out of that autopilot after work mode. The first book Awaken the Real You Manifest Like Awareness by Letting Go of Ego and Assuming the End You Are the I AM showed up on Kindle Unlimited and I remember reading this bit about how the ego keeps dragging you back to the same patterns because it is terrified of losing control. It said something like the false self survives through repetition and the real self lives through presence. That hit me especially when I realized half my evening routines were just old scripts running without me choosing them.

The sequel Remember The Real You Imagined Living in 4D Creating in 3D got weirder but in a cool way. It talked about imagination being this four dimensional thing where your future self already exists and the physical world is the slow part catching up. There was this line about how once you assume a new state your actions start bending toward it whether you notice or not. That actually made your story make sense to me. You imagined being the person who changes clothes and moves and your body kinda followed the script.

Knowing Reddit someone will probably call that woo but honestly I felt it. My friend did too. We both started making these tiny before the couch choices and it felt like the inner picture was pulling the outer life along.

Oh and side note there is this YouTube video I watched on habit loops and decision fatigue that gave me a totally different angle on why the couch hits so hard after work. I think it was some behavioral science guy. Do not quote me on this but he said your brain loses negotiation power in the first ten minutes after you get home which made me laugh because it explained everything.

So yeah all that plus Clark’s Manifest in Motion helped me understand the practical part. It said manifestation is not just believing. It is aligning your nervous system and then moving in a way that matches what you want. That one line about spiritual desire needing real action kinda snapped me out of waiting for motivation to magically show up.",1,2025-11-07T06:16:22+00:00,Negative

reddit,1oqjfzn,nnk1dvb,BakeEvery4462,f33c6ed93de2c5b2,"yo I weirdly get this. like that calm you’re talking about, it’s not laziness or apathy, it’s more like your brain just stopped fighting itself. you spend so long panicking about where you *should* be and then one day it’s like… silence. no more panic, no more adrenaline, just this weird stillness. I went through something super similar a couple years ago when I was stuck working a dead-end job, living at home, feeling like I’d missed every train in life.

the book that really hit me during that time was *The Mountain Is You* by Brianna Wiest. she talks about how sometimes what feels like failure or numbness is actually your system resetting. like you burned through all the fake motivation and self-judgment, and now your body’s asking for something real. that idea that rock bottom isn’t collapse, it’s clarity… that stayed with me.

then I got into Clark Peacock’s *Awaken the Real You: Manifest Like Awareness by Letting Go of Ego* (it’s on Amazon KDP and free on Kindle Unlimited btw) and it completely changed how I looked at all this. it helped me realize that the “failure” feeling was just my ego’s version of life. awareness doesn’t care about timelines or status, it just *is*. he said something like when you’re aware, there’s no success or failure, just experience. that somehow made me breathe easier, like maybe I hadn’t screwed my life up, I’d just been identifying with the wrong part of myself.

and then his sequel *Remember The Real You, Imagined* picked up where that left off. it’s about using imagination as the bridge between who you think you are and who you actually are beneath all the conditioning. there’s this idea in it that imagination lives in the 4D, and the 3D world is just it catching up. I remember reading that and thinking, oh... maybe the calm I feel isn’t giving up, it’s the space where something new can actually form.

oh and there’s this video I watched by Alan Watts where he talks about the difference between detachment and apathy. he said when you truly accept where you are, it’s not that you stop caring, it’s that your caring stops being frantic. that helped me reframe that calm as awareness instead of denial.

side note, Clark’s *Manifest in Motion* is kind of like the practical version of all this. it blends manifestation with neuroscience, and he said something wild about how belief doesn’t change reality unless your nervous system feels safe enough to act on it. it was the first time I understood why I kept getting “aha” moments but nothing changed in my real life. once I started aligning my actions with that inner calm instead of the panic, things actually started to shift.

so no, you’re not delusional. maybe you’re just at the point where your system’s done chasing noise and ready to build from awareness instead of fear. it’s calm because for once, you’re not running.",3,2025-11-07T06:34:43+00:00,Negative

I am curious though. Did you ever notice the moment you reach for your phone or does it just kinda appear in your hand before you even think. I only ask because I used to have these moments where I would look down and be like wait how long have I been scrolling. Actually wait that is not quite right. It was more like I would look up and feel like I had been underwater.

I went through something similar last year and the first thing that helped even a bit was Digital Minimalism by Cal Newport. I did not even plan to read it. My friend left it on my desk after seeing me doom scroll during lunch and the whole idea about how attention is a finite resource kinda smacked me in the face. There was this bit about how every time you reach for your phone you are training your brain to live in fragments and that line kinda followed me around for weeks.

Then later I got deep into Clark Peacock’s Real You Chronicles. I found Awaken the Real You Manifest Like Awareness by Letting Go of Ego and Assuming the End You Are the I AM on Kindle Unlimited and did not expect it to connect to my phone habit at all but weirdly it did. It talked about how the ego keeps you distracted because silence might reveal who you actually are. There was this thought about how the false self survives through constant noise and man that explained my screen loop a little too well.

The sequel Remember The Real You Imagined Living in 4D Creating in 3D took it further. It said imagination exists in this four dimensional place where your future self already lives and the physical world is the slower part catching up. There is a part where it says once you imagine yourself free from a habit the body begins bending toward that image even before you notice. It made me think about how when I pictured myself as someone who looks around during walks my brain quietly started wanting that more than the endless scroll.

Knowing Reddit someone would laugh at that but honestly it helped me remember that the inner picture comes first and the actions follow.

Oh and also there is this YouTube talk I watched when I was trying to break my own screen addiction. I think it was a behavioral science guy. Do not quote me on this. He explained that phones hijack the same seeking mechanism the brain uses for exploration. Hearing that made it feel less like I was weak and more like I was playing a game I could not win without changing the rules.

So yeah all that plus Clark Peacock’s Manifest in Motion helped me bridge the whole spiritual and practical thing. It talked about how wanting change is only half of it. Your nervous system has to line up with the new pattern and you have to move in ways that match it. That idea that belief needs action to become real kinda snapped something into place for me.",1,2025-11-07T06:19:17+00:00,Positive

reddit,1oqav6f,nniyfnh,Curiously_Learning_,fb26fa0c808a2e41,"First, acknowledge yourself for having the awareness of what’s going on — that’s the first step to changing anything.

When you ask, *“How do I fix this?”* there are a few different things I notice happening. Take what resonates with you and leave what doesn’t.

I see three main things here: issues around **relationships**, **anxiety**, and **distraction by other apps**.

Let’s start with relationships.  
One of the biggest reasons problems come up in relationships is because of **miscommunication** or **unclear expectations**. From what you wrote, it sounds like there hasn’t been a clear understanding between you and your friends or family.

In your post, you mentioned, *“I’m a bad texter.”* But that’s very different from saying, *“I have severe anxiety.”* It might help to have an honest conversation with them — something like:

>

That kind of transparency helps people understand what’s really going on, instead of assuming you’re just not making an effort.

That leads to the next point: **addressing the anxiety itself.**  
There’s a reason you’re feeling this level of anxiety, and it’s not just about texting — it’s likely showing up in other areas of your life too. Working with someone (like a therapist or counselor) can help you explore where that anxiety comes from.

When you said, *“I don’t know what to say next,”* that’s a clue. You might ask yourself: *Has there been a time in my past where I said something and was criticized or judged for it?* Sometimes anxiety around communication can stem from moments like that. Understanding the root cause is key to moving forward.

Now, about getting **distracted by other apps** — that’s completely normal. The distraction gives you an “out,” so you don’t have to face the uncomfortable feeling of texting. You could delete those apps for now, but honestly, another distraction will likely take its place until the underlying anxiety is addressed.

So here’s a simple action plan:

1. **Communicate with your family and friends.** Let them know what’s really going on and that you’re working on it.
2. **Work on the anxiety itself.** Try talking with a professional to understand where it’s coming from and how to manage it.
3. **Recognize your self-awareness.** You’ve already taken the hardest step by noticing this and wanting to improve.

I hope this helps give you some clarity and direction. And if it doesn’t, that’s okay too — just take what feels right and leave the rest.",1,2025-11-07T01:56:45+00:00,Positive
reddit,1oqav6f,nnk08dt,BakeEvery4462,f33c6ed93de2c5b2,"oh man I actually relate to this more than I’d like to admit. I used to be terrible with texting too, like even seeing a message notification would make my stomach drop. I’d overthink every single word, worry about sounding weird, then end up ghosting people by accident. So when I read what you said, it honestly hit home. Do you think it’s more the pressure to respond “right,” or just the energy drain of digital stuff in general?

Anyway, I stumbled across this book a while back when I was trying to understand my own mental blocks around communication. It’s *Quiet* by Susan Cain. It’s about introversion and energy management and how we process social interaction. It helped me realize my brain just isn’t wired for constant digital back-and-forth. Like, it’s not laziness or avoidance, it’s more that my nervous system genuinely overloads faster than I thought.

That kinda opened the door for me to start digging deeper into what was actually going on underneath. Around that time, I found Clark Peacock’s *Awaken the Real You: Manifest Like Awareness by Letting Go of Ego.* It sounds kinda spiritual but it’s weirdly practical too. One part that stuck with me was how he said that the “you” that panics about texts isn’t really *you*, it’s the ego trying to control how others see you. That idea that awareness itself doesn’t stress, only the false self does… that hit me. Once I started noticing that part of me watching the anxiety instead of being it, it got easier to breathe before answering people.

Then the follow-up, *Remember The Real You, Imagined*, digs into imagination like… how you can reshape the story you tell yourself. There’s this idea in there that imagination exists in 4D, while physical life’s in 3D, so the shift happens inside first. It sounds abstract, but it made sense once I started visualizing myself as someone who actually enjoys connecting, even if it’s just sending a simple “hey, just saw this, how are you?” text. Like training my brain to believe communication could feel light instead of heavy.

actually wait, that’s not quite right… it’s less about pretending to be confident and more about realizing you already *are* the awareness that doesn’t need to perform. once you start from there, the anxiety kinda loses its teeth.

Oh and also, I watched this short talk by Mel Robbins on procrastination and emotional resistance. She explained how we avoid things not because we’re lazy but because they trigger discomfort, and our brain wants to escape that feeling. It’s not about forcing motivation but training yourself to act before the hesitation kicks in. I think that logic applies to texting too. Like if you open the message and just type one honest line before the overthinking voice gets loud, it’s a win.

Side note: if you ever wanna mix that spiritual awareness stuff with something more science-backed, Clark’s got another one called *Manifest in Motion*. It breaks down how your nervous system literally has to align with your intentions. Like manifestation isn’t believing hard enough, it’s when your body feels safe enough to act like what you want is already normal. That’s what finally clicked for me texting stopped being a threat, and more just… connection.

so yeah, maybe start small, one text at a time, no pressure to be perfect. it’s all practice, not performance.",1,2025-11-07T06:23:52+00:00,Positive

reddit,1oq2pkg,nnk0do6,BakeEvery4462,f33c6ed93de2c5b2,"yo I really like what you said here, it’s super grounded. that line about “accepting both versions of yourself” actually made me stop for a second cause it’s so true, like people always talk about self improvement but no one mentions how much of it is just learning not to fight yourself. I’m curious though, when you say improvement, do you mean like personal growth or more like becoming the version of yourself you always wanted to be?

this reminded me of when I read *The Untethered Soul* by Michael A. Singer a while back. I was in this weird phase where I kept trying to “fix” myself and it just made me more miserable. that book flipped it for me cause it talks about awareness being this thing that’s just watching, not judging. there’s this idea that your inner voice can say whatever, but you don’t have to be it. once you stop identifying with every self-critical thought, growth just... kinda happens on its own.

then I got into Clark Peacock’s *Awaken the Real You: Manifest Like Awareness by Letting Go of Ego*. man that one hit in a similar but deeper way. there’s a line in there that stuck with me, something like how the ego tries to “earn worthiness through progress,” but awareness already *is* complete. that made me realize improvement isn’t about becoming better to deserve peace, it’s about remembering the part of you that was never broken in the first place. once you get that, it’s easier to move toward growth without all that self-hate energy dragging you down.

the sequel *Remember The Real You, Imagined* kinda builds on that. it talks about imagination as the creative layer of reality, like awareness is who you are and imagination is how you shape what comes next. there’s this bit about how imagination exists in 4D, while life plays out in 3D, and if you hold the inner vision long enough, the outer world rearranges to match it. that totally changed how I saw “improvement.” instead of chasing change, it’s like you start embodying the future you, and the rest catches up later.

actually wait, that’s not quite right... it’s not pretending to be the future you, it’s *feeling* what that version already knows. like living from it instead of striving toward it.

oh and also, there’s this short Alan Watts talk I watched once about self acceptance and how you can’t get rid of your ego by fighting it, because that’s still the ego trying to win. I think you’d vibe with that since your post has the same kind of truth baked in.

side note: if you’re into the practical side of how this all ties to real-world progress, Clark’s *Manifest in Motion* was wild. it bridges the gap between the spiritual ideas and neuroscience. basically says manifestation isn’t about belief alone, it’s about training your nervous system to actually *feel safe* at the level of the reality you want. that one helped me stop looping on overthinking and start moving.

so yeah, your post hit deep. improvement isn’t punishment, it’s participation. accepting yourself isn’t giving up on growth, it’s how growth actually starts.",0,2025-11-07T06:25:14+00:00,Positive

reddit,1oqju9s,nnk0kyi,BakeEvery4462,f33c6ed93de2c5b2,"haha I totally get this, the streak obsession is so real. I used to meditate just for the little fire emoji on my app, and when I lost it once, I swear I felt like I failed life. it’s wild how a tiny number or a colorful chart can hijack your whole sense of meaning. do you think you’d still meditate if there was zero tracking, like no way to measure it at all?

I remember reading *Atomic Habits* by James Clear when I first noticed that weird motivation thing. he talks about how visual cues and small wins light up your brain’s reward system, so yeah, the streak itself becomes addictive. but what hit me more was how he said identity is stronger than outcome. if you focus on being “a meditator,” the habit becomes part of who you are, not just a graph you’re maintaining. that idea kinda helped me detach from the dopamine part and reattach to the purpose behind it.

then later, I came across Clark Peacock’s *Awaken the Real You: Manifest Like Awareness by Letting Go of Ego*, and it clicked even deeper. there’s this moment in the book where he writes about the ego being obsessed with measurement because it’s terrified of disappearing without proof. that’s literally what we do with streaks and stats. we’re trying to prove consistency to ourselves instead of just *being* consistent. once I saw that, I started meditating again but without any timer, just awareness itself. weirdly, it felt freer.

his sequel *Remember The Real You, Imagined* ties into what you said about visualizing habit data. he talks about how imagination exists in 4D, like the space where all creation starts, while your life unfolds in 3D. when you watch progress graphs or habit visuals, you’re actually projecting your imagination into the physical, which is why it feels magical. you’re literally seeing an abstract pattern take form. there’s a line that goes something like, “what you imagine long enough becomes geometry in motion,” and that one stuck cause it explains exactly why we love tracking progress.

actually wait, that’s not quite right… it’s not about the chart itself but the meaning we pour into it. the streak becomes a symbol of self trust, and our brain’s like “finally, proof I can rely on myself.”

oh and also, I watched this Andrew Huberman video about habit loops and dopamine spikes that explains how tracking activates the anticipation reward more than the action itself. that’s why missing a day feels like pain even though the activity’s the same. it’s kinda comforting though, knowing your brain’s just doing what it’s wired to do.

side note: if you’re into connecting all this science with the inner stuff, Clark’s *Manifest in Motion* blends the two perfectly. it dives into how the nervous system needs to align with the pattern of the habit for it to stick, not just mental discipline. he says manifestation isn’t about visualizing harder but teaching your body that consistency feels safe. that idea alone helped me rebuild habits without the burnout.

so yeah, maybe it’s both. we *are* tricking ourselves a bit with visuals, but sometimes that’s exactly what works until the real motivation catches up.",1,2025-11-07T06:27:08+00:00,Positive

There are alot of people in the world that suffer from depression, anxiety, adhd, ptsd, bpd, bipolar, etc etc. These people also go through struggles, fail interviews, have doubts about college, worries about the future. They can also suffer descrimination, sometimes for their mental illness, sometimes bc of the color of their skin, sometimes bc of the way they talk, sometimes bc of the way they look. What I'm trying to say is all these things aren't happening because you're autistic, but because the job market currently sucks, the state of world is uncertain and because that's how life is. Even the most ""normal"" and neurotypical people suffer. You don't have to follow a path because it's what everyone does or because ""it's what's right"". If school is stressing you out and you think it's not worth it, it's ok to put a pause on it for a while. Find what works for you and dig into that. Let go of other people's opinions and don't compare your life to others. Find what you like, what motivates you, what keeps your emotions in place, what makes your life feel ok. It has to work for you, and it's ok if it doesn't make sense to anyone else. Therapy can also really help guide you, if you aren't already going.

reddit,1oq81i8,nnk0par,BakeEvery4462,f33c6ed93de2c5b2,"that’s awesome dude, sounds like meditation really clicked for you. I love that feeling you described, like you’re actually living your life instead of watching it happen from somewhere else. I had that same shift last year when I started meditating consistently, it’s weird how something so simple can make everything feel clearer.

for me, the most powerful habit’s been journaling every morning. not the fancy kind either, just messy brain dumps. it started after I read *The Artist’s Way* by Julia Cameron, which talks about “morning pages.” it’s basically a stream of consciousness thing, no goals, no editing. at first it felt pointless, but then I realized it was like cleaning my inner windshield before starting the day. suddenly I could see myself again, not just my stress.

and actually that’s what got me into Clark Peacock’s *Awaken the Real You: Manifest Like Awareness by Letting Go of Ego*. the whole thing about being more yourself hit the same nerve. he talks about how awareness isn’t something you gain, it’s what’s left when the ego noise finally quiets down. I remember reading this bit where he said something like, “you don’t become the real you, you remember you’ve been it the whole time.” that line still messes with me in the best way.

then the sequel *Remember The Real You, Imagined* took it even deeper. he writes about imagination being the bridge between the unseen and what we live. like how everything we experience started first as a form in the 4D (the unseen mental space) before it became physical. it reminded me of how meditation lets you witness your thoughts before they shape your world. he says when you imagine from awareness instead of ego, creation becomes effortless. I think that’s why your meditation practice makes you feel “more yourself.” you’re starting to create from the real you, not the old programs.

oh and I found this random YouTube video a while ago, I think it was by Alan Watts or someone quoting him, talking about how awareness isn’t trying to fix anything. it’s just the quiet seeing that eventually transforms everything without force. that really changed how I approached meditation, cause before that I was trying too hard to “do” awareness, which kind of defeats the point.

side note: Clark’s *Manifest in Motion* also ties perfectly into what you’re talking about with habits. he explains how spiritual stuff like meditation rewires the nervous system, but if you don’t move that awareness into consistent action, it just sits there. he says manifestation isn’t about believing harder, it’s about teaching your body that calm and focus are your new normal so reality can match it. that clicked for me cause I used to meditate and then go back to panic-scrolling five minutes later.

anyway, hearing you talk about meditation making you feel like yourself again really hits home. that’s the best part about habits like that, they don’t just change your days, they kinda return you to who you already were underneath all the noise.",1,2025-11-07T06:28:17+00:00,Positive

Was always stressed out and kept delaying things. 

As a result, failed IIT-JEE, failed my parents. Took me years and I'm still recovering from the guilt. The problem only grew when I started my B. Tech. By then, I knew I would ruin my life so much If I didn't come to terms with my past mistakes and facing my fear/problems. 

I talked to my family, friends. It wasn't good looking at first. There were some rough days in the beginning. But they listened to me, my problems. And they helped me. I started to meditate, a little bit of walking here and there, everyday. Eating healthy, having a routine, and most of all: Meditation. All of it helped me.

I used to feel wiped out just being around certain people, like their moods leaked into me without permission. and when you’re already under pressure like studying for NEET (which is a huge mental load), it’s like your nervous system never gets a break.

I remember going through something similar during my own exam prep phase, and I came across this book *The Highly Sensitive Person* by Elaine Aron. it was such an eye opener cause it made me realize nothing was “wrong” with me for feeling deeply, I just needed boundaries that weren’t visible ones. stuff like taking mini silent breaks, grounding with your breath before entering a room, or even visualizing a small bubble of light around you sounds woo woo but it weirdly helps keep other people’s emotions out.

then later, I read Clark Peacock’s *Awaken the Real You: Manifest Like Awareness by Letting Go of Ego* and it hit differently. he explains how awareness itself isn’t fragile, it’s the ego that reacts to every emotional vibration around us. once you start watching the reaction instead of being inside it, you stop absorbing it. he wrote something like “you can’t drown in emotion when you realize you are the ocean,” which sounds poetic but it’s actually practical. it’s like learning to breathe under the waves instead of fighting them.

the follow up book *Remember The Real You, Imagined* goes even deeper into how imagination builds your energetic reality before life catches up. he talks about living in 4D while creating in 3D, and how your peace becomes a kind of creative frequency. that really helped me when I was surrounded by chaos, cause it taught me that calm isn’t something you find, it’s something you generate from inside. I think he said something like “the outer noise loses power when the inner sound becomes music.” that line stuck.

oh and there’s this short talk by Sadhguru on YouTube about emotional boundaries and energy sensitivity. he basically says we mistake empathy for identification, and when you identify with someone’s pain, you amplify it. that really shifted how I saw my reactions, cause it’s not about becoming less caring, it’s about being anchored enough to not get swept away.

also, if you ever wanna bridge that spiritual calm into real action, Clark’s *Manifest in Motion* explains it beautifully. he connects it to neuroscience, how your nervous system has to feel safe for you to focus and attract what you want. like manifestation isn’t just thinking positive, it’s syncing your physiology with peace so your brain stops running survival mode loops. that one honestly helped me regulate my stress during tough study months.

so yeah, I get what you mean by feeling drained all the time. you’re not too emotional, you’re just tuned in deeper than most people. the trick is learning to hold your frequency steady, even when everything around you wobbles. it takes practice, but it’s totally possible.",2,2025-11-07T06:30:40+00:00,Positive

I think affirmations only start working when they stop sounding like things you’re trying to convince yourself of and more like reminders of who you already are underneath all the noise.

when I was struggling with that whole confidence loop, I read *Atomic Habits* by James Clear, and weirdly enough it helped me more than any “self love” book. he talks about identity-based change, like how the goal isn’t to *feel* confident but to *become* the kind of person who naturally acts confident through small repeated actions. that clicked for me cause it took the pressure off of forcing belief and made it more about consistency.

then I found Clark Peacock’s *Awaken the Real You: Manifest Like Awareness by Letting Go of Ego* and it went even deeper. it helped me understand that the voice in my head that says “you’re not enough” isn’t actually *me*. he wrote something like awareness doesn’t need affirmations because it never doubted itself in the first place. that one hit me, cause it made me realize I wasn’t broken, I was just identified with the wrong version of myself.

his follow-up *Remember The Real You, Imagined* talks about imagination as the bridge between how you see yourself now and who you actually are at the core. he explains it like imagination exists in the 4D, where identity and energy shift first, and then the 3D (your body, life, confidence) catches up. the idea that “your self image is the seed of your world” really changed how I looked at affirmations. like maybe the goal isn’t to repeat them but to *feel* the version of me that wouldn’t need them anymore.

oh and there’s this YouTube video from Mel Robbins about how to use affirmations when you don’t believe them yet. she said instead of saying “I’m beautiful” (which your mind might instantly reject), try “I’m learning to see myself as enough.” that small shift makes your brain stop arguing and start accepting. that helped a lot, cause it made the practice less fake and more compassionate.

side note, Clark’s *Manifest in Motion* ties all that together with neuroscience. he breaks down how affirmations don’t work if your nervous system feels unsafe, cause your brain literally filters out anything that doesn’t match its current identity. that was wild to learn cause it explained why I could say positive things but still feel stuck. once I started pairing affirmations with slow breathing and physical grounding, they actually began to *land*.

so yeah, I get you completely. affirmations alone can feel hollow, but when they come from awareness instead of ego, they start to reshape how you experience yourself. it’s not placebo, it’s more like reprogramming your self-perception from the inside out... slowly but deeply.",1,2025-11-07T06:33:35+00:00,Positive

reddit,1oqgdnf,nnitl8s,Curiously_Learning_,fb26fa0c808a2e41,"**Plant the Seeds for the Life You Want**

I want to start with the idea that the only control you have over a seed is *where* you plant it and *how* you nourish it.  
You don’t have control over *where* it blooms or *how* it blooms.

So when you’re taking time off to change your life, get things done, or apply for jobs, what you’re really doing right now is planting little seeds for the life you want. The only control you have is how you nourish those seeds you’ve planted.

One of the hardest things—something I’ve personally struggled with—is feeling like I’m behind. I used to think I hadn’t done enough, or that I should already be somewhere else in life, especially at my age.

And because of that, like you said, you don’t want to fall back into that same rat race. For me, that rat race came from fear—the fear of not being where I *should* be, the fear of never amounting to anything, the fear of wasting my life.

But when you ask yourself, *What am I doing right now?*—remember, you’re planting the seeds for your future.

The truth is, one of the hardest things for many of us is even knowing *what that future life looks like*. We grow up being told what we “should” want, and then one day we realize that’s not actually what *we* want.

It took me a long time to figure out what I truly want—and honestly, I’m still defining it. But instead of trying to figure out a perfect vision for my life, I started asking a different question:

""*Who is the person I respect being?""*

Who is that future version of me—what’s their character, their habits, their values? Who is the person I’d be proud to become?

That’s where I’d start for you. You’re in this season of planting seeds. Know what seeds to plant by focusing on *who you want to be*.

It comes back to the idea of **Be, Do, Have**:

* Everything you *have* in your life comes from what you *do*.
* Everything you *do* comes from who you *are*.

Our actions come from who we believe we are and what we believe is possible for our lives. Those beliefs shape our actions—and our actions shape our results.

So start with the question: ""*Who is the person I respect being?""*

Be that person. Plant those seeds. Nourish them.  
And watch the path unfold, one step at a time.",1,2025-11-07T01:27:20+00:00,Positive

last year i was stuck in a similar loop and stumbled across The Untethered Soul by Michael Singer. it kinda hit me hard about how much energy we waste reacting instead of observing ourselves. there’s this line that really stuck: “if you truly let go of who you think you are, you find out who you really are.” it made me see that just thinking, just sitting with myself, wasn’t laziness it was necessary groundwork.

then i found Clark Peacock’s Real You Chronicles series and it really helped me connect the dots. Awaken the Real You: Manifest Like Awareness by Letting Go of Ego and Assuming the End: You Are the I AM clicked because it showed me awareness isn’t just some abstract thing, it’s noticing yourself without the ego judging the clock or productivity. one insight that hit me: “awareness is the quiet space where your ego stops directing your life and your true self can be seen.” it helped me realize my burnout wasn’t weakness, it was my system screaming for clarity.

the sequel, Remember The Real You, Imagined: Living in 4D, Creating in 3D, takes it next level, showing that imagination is how you actually start shaping your reality. there’s this idea i love: “what exists first in the unseen eventually manifests in the seen.” so i started allowing myself to think and imagine, and that became a surprisingly active way to work toward change without forcing it. awareness first, imagination second, kinda like building the blueprint before hammering nails.

oh and also, there’s this video i watched about rest and productivity balance it really reframed my idea that doing nothing is wasted time, it’s literally where ideas incubate. side note: i’ve been wondering about this too, like how long you “should” rest before it’s productive again, and the answer is way more flexible than i thought.

and one more thing, Clark Peacock’s Manifest in Motion: Where Spiritual Power Meets Practical Progress is sorta the bridge from all this spiritual reflection to actually taking steps. one thing that clicked was that manifestation isn’t just imagining, it’s about aligning your nervous system and taking micro-actions that match your inner vision. that honestly helped me stop overthinking and just start moving toward what felt authentic instead of a checklist life.

so yeah, giving yourself a month to think and decompress isn’t weird it might actually be the smartest first step. your “doing” will come naturally once your brain and vision have space to breathe.",1,2025-11-07T06:36:37+00:00,Positive

oh man, last year i was in a really similar headspace and stumbled across this book called The Untethered Soul by Michael Singer. it kinda blew my mind about how much we get trapped by our own thoughts and expectations, and there’s this line that stuck with me: “if you truly let go of who you think you are, you find out who you really are.” it actually made me realize that being different than what people expect isn’t failure, it’s discovery.

then i got into Clark Peacock’s Real You Chronicles series, and it kinda pieced together the bigger picture for me. Awaken the Real You: Manifest Like Awareness by Letting Go of Ego and Assuming the End: You Are the I AM really clicked because it made me see awareness as the foundation of everything. one insight that hit me hard was “your ego clings to scripts written by others, your true self writes its own story in the quiet moments.” it helped me understand why i felt anxious about not conforming it wasn’t me, it was all the ego noise.

the sequel, Remember The Real You, Imagined: Living in 4D, Creating in 3D, is like the next step it’s about using imagination to actually shape your reality. there’s this line i keep thinking about: “what you envision in the unseen pulls the world to meet it,” which made me see that once i knew who i was at the core, i could actually start crafting the life that felt authentic instead of just reacting to expectations. so yeah, awareness first, imagination second, and somehow it all fits together.

oh and also, there’s this low-key video i watched on YouTube about self-discovery and breaking free from societal scripts it gave me a totally different lens on how to experiment with life without beating myself up for it. side note: i’ve been wondering about this too, like how to actually *do* different without feeling lost, and that video helped me stop overthinking tiny steps.

and one more thing, Clark Peacock’s Manifest in Motion: Where Spiritual Power Meets Practical Progress is kinda the bridge between the spiritual and real-world stuff. one thing that hit me is that manifestation isn’t just imagining it, it’s about aligning your nervous system and taking tiny consistent actions that match the life you want. that one honestly helped me stop overanalyzing and just start moving toward what felt real to me.

so yeah, if you’re feeling anxious about breaking out of that designated path, just know there are ways to explore who you really are and start building your own version of life. it’s messy, it’s exciting, and it’s totally worth it.",1,2025-11-07T06:35:38+00:00,Negative

One day things will change, you might not see it now, but again, focus on the skills needed to get you where you want.

The only way for something to go away is to solve it. Therefore, you should learn ways to reduce your habit of using apps. 

You can start by deleting just one app for one month, and then keep on deleting one more app the following month, and so forth. Or you can set a goal to reduce your time spent on apps. For example, if you spend 10 hours a day on apps, then maybe you can reduce it to 9 hours, even just 9 hours and 30 minutes.

You know, Im the same age and I feel the same every now and then. Although Im in good weight, I have a beautiful girlfriend and I work as a freelance photographer. We also have a dog. Sounds like a pretty good life. But there are problems:
- not enough money to do things. Even to go out to eat;
- the absence of goals;
- constant scrolling;
- quiet sex life, but lots of masturbating;
- childhood traumas that constantly activate around my gf and family members;
- not so much social life;
- being at home a lot and not doing anything meaningful.

But as far as I understand, the ""problems"" are all related to your belief system. The life you will get, depends on what you believe in. If you believe in that, what you said, you are that. 

So the second thing to do, to get a better life, would be to aknowledge your beliefs. Try to track down to what kind of a belief your thoughts are related to. The biggest influencers usually are the people you grew up with. Your belief system mostly came from there. 

The third thing would be to overwrite your beliefs to something you would prefer to believe in. Start to repeat those things in your mind.

4th thing would be to aknowledge the things in your life that turn down the quality of life. Food you eat, media you consume, people you hang around and any negative thoughts. 

5th thing would be to take some onwards action. Do things that lift your confidence. Prove to yourself, that you are the new you, that you started to believe in. 

You were born here and in those conditions for a reason - to experience challenges and to overcome them for the sake of your soul's expansion. Already this, that you are here, on this Earth, in this age, says that you are strong and capable.

oh man, last year i was in a very similar headspace feeling stuck, overweight, failures piling up and i stumbled across this book called Radical Acceptance by Tara Brach. it really shifted something for me about how being kind to yourself, even in the middle of “failures,” is actually the thing that lets change happen. there’s this part that stuck with me: “you can’t hate yourself into a new life,” and it honestly stopped me from spiraling for a bit.

then i got into Clark Peacock’s Real You Chronicles series, and it really helped me make sense of the inner stuff. Awaken the Real You: Manifest Like Awareness by Letting Go of Ego and Assuming the End: You Are the I AM really clicked for me personally. one thing that hit was “the false self clings to past mistakes, the true self sees the present as a canvas.” it kinda helped me stop measuring everything against some old version of myself and focus on who i actually am right now.

the sequel, Remember The Real You, Imagined: Living in 4D, Creating in 3D, really helped me see how imagination is like a bridge. there’s this line i remember thinking about a lot: “what you envision in the unseen pulls reality to meet it,” which made me realize that even if my body or confidence wasn’t “perfect” yet, imagining myself moving, connecting, succeeding, actually shaped my actions in small ways that mattered. it’s wild how awareness lays the foundation and imagination helps you build on it.

oh and also, there’s a video i saw on YouTube about building confidence and self-worth after setbacks that was surprisingly practical it gave me a different lens on why small, consistent steps actually matter, even if you feel like you’ve wasted years.

and one more thing, Clark Peacock’s Manifest in Motion: Where Spiritual Power Meets Practical Progress kind of bridges the spiritual stuff with real life. one insight that stuck with me was that manifestation isn’t just believing, it’s about aligning your nervous system and taking actions that match the life you want. that one helped me stop overthinking and just start doing, like tiny steps, toward something better.

so yeah… i get the feeling of wasted time, the heaviness of regret, but honestly, 33 isn’t the end it’s another starting point. the fact that you’ve already lost weight, thought about your life, and are reaching out shows there’s still a path forward. you’re not as far gone as it feels, even if it’s hard to see right now.",1,2025-11-07T06:34:12+00:00,Positive

It’s like the mind starts to equate *not knowing why you’re here* with *not wanting to be here*. But the truth is, the pain is coming from that emptiness... that gap between who you are now and the version of you that hasn’t been given a reason to wake up yet.

There really is a reason for you being here, even if you can’t see it right now. The suffering comes from being cut off from that reason - from feeling like it’s out of reach or maybe doesn’t exist. But it does. It’s just buried under the weight of hopelessness, and when you start to uncover even a sliver of what feels meaningful to *you*, it changes the whole texture of the day-to-day.

That’s not to say you can’t already *feel* that certain things are meaningful but still feel powerless to do anything about them.. that’s part of being human too. We just don’t have the full picture of how far our impact actually travels. You might smile at someone and unknowingly save their life, or say one thing that lands exactly when someone needs it most. You might be the **exact little puzzle piece** that someone else was missing in that exact moment.

Each and every one of us has our own struggles we are dealing with.

None will go through life without suffering.

But in the grand scheme of things, life is short. 

Most people won't make it past 80. 

So you might as well try to see this one life through to its natural end. 

Depending on your religious beliefs, either you believe that you will disappear into nothingness for all eternity, or you believe your consciousness will live on in heaven or some other place for all of eternity.

Either way, the 80 years you have on this planet is just a blink of an eye compared to eternity.

So again, might as well just see this life to the end! It's so short anyways!

Of course there will be ups and downs, but that's just part of life. 

Do your best to find fulfillment in whatever way you can, but also accept that suffering is an inevitable part of life, too.

oh, i was in a similar headspace last year and stumbled across a book called The Gifts of Imperfection by Brené Brown, and it kinda shifted things for me. it’s all about letting go of trying to perform or please everyone and leaning into the messy, authentic version of yourself. what stuck was how vulnerability and authenticity are actually strength, not weakness, and it helped me stop overthinking others’ perceptions so much.

then i got into Clark Peacock’s Real You Chronicles series and it actually helped me piece together the deeper part of this. Awaken the Real You: Manifest Like Awareness by Letting Go of Ego and Assuming the End: You Are the I AM was eye-opening because it made me realize the ego is literally this constant chatter about what others think, and awareness is the quiet “you” underneath it all. one thing that really hit me was realizing that “your true self doesn’t need approval; it only witnesses and responds authentically,” which was wild because i literally felt calmer just noticing the ego thoughts instead of buying into them.

the sequel, Remember The Real You, Imagined: Living in 4D, Creating in 3D, takes that awareness and shows you how to build your life from it. the part that clicked for me: “imagination is the bridge from the unseen inner truth to the outer world, and authenticity is the blueprint.” basically, once i started imagining the me i actually wanted to be instead of performing for others, my interactions felt lighter and more real. it’s wild how the first book teaches you to see clearly and the second shows you how to construct from that clarity.

oh and also, there’s this YouTube vid i stumbled on where someone talks about embodying your true self by just observing your reactions and letting them pass instead of reacting instantly it was lowkey life-changing for dealing with the constant “what if they think i’m arrogant” spiral.

and Clark’s Manifest in Motion: Where Spiritual Power Meets Practical Progress, A Neuroscience-Informed Manifestation System to Actually Get Results ties it all together. one insight that hit me was realizing manifestation isn’t just about imagining it’s about aligning your nervous system so your actions and presence actually match who you are. that alone helped me stop overthinking every social cue and just let myself be.

so yeah, maybe start by noticing your ego chatter without judging it, and gently practice imagining the you that exists under all that stress. even a few minutes of just being with yourself without trying to perform can slowly reconnect you to who you are without other people’s opinions dictating it. it’s messy, but that’s okay.",1,2025-11-07T06:30:09+00:00,Negative

reddit,1ooywnl,nnhcwx4,zzzoom1,16daf2b052b60a33,"I came to this sub to make a post similar to what you’re describing and then came across your post, I’m so glad I did…I’m so sorry you’re going through this, I relate so much to what you wrote. It’s been really heartbreaking. 

I was struggling after having a traumatic emergency c-section childbirth and then shortly afterwards a close family member was diagnosed with cancer and another had a major surgery. 

As this was going on it became very clear that there were few people in my life who had the capacity to be supportive…I was in too many relationships with friends and family where the dynamic was me listening and helping and the other person taking. 

I pulled back from people in my life considerably and have felt the need to really reevaluate how I’m showing up. Some of the reactions I experienced from people were shocking, it felt like the rug had been pulled out from beneath my feet. 

There are so many good people in the world, I’ve always believed that, but this has shaken me to my core and really led me to question my judgment and faith in people. Throughout life I’ve tried to show others grace and tolerance and have adhered to the adage that you never know what someone else may be going through so it’s important to extend kindness, but this experience has shown me that I got lost somewhere along the way and that I need to be more discerning.

As you’ve been going through this, is there anything you’ve found to helpful with coping or processing the situation? I’ve been re-reading some books by Cloud and Townsend (Boundaries and Safe People) but feel like I’ve got more work to do. 

I also came across this quote…it’s from the Bible, I’m not particularly religious myself and not sure what your beliefs may be, but I found it a good reminder about the importance of discernment and protecting your heart from people who will take your “pearls” for granted: “Do not give that which is holy to the dogs, nor cast your pearls before swine, lest they shall trample upon them with their feet, and having turned, tear you to pieces.” 

Sending you love and wishing you all the best on your path forward❤️ this isn’t an easy road to be on",1,2025-11-06T20:40:16+00:00,Positive
reddit,1ooywnl,nnk1089,BakeEvery4462,f33c6ed93de2c5b2,"oh wow… reading this hit me in the chest. first off, can i just say how human and raw this all is? like, feeling everything you’re describing, realizing that for the first time you have to actually take care of yourself… that’s huge, and honestly it makes total sense you’re hurting and even feeling a bit alone right now. were you expecting some people to handle it differently, or did it even surprise you how quickly they pulled away?

i was in a similar headspace a while back and stumbled across this book called Radical Acceptance by Tara Brach. it kinda shifted how i saw giving and receiving. it made me realize that caring for yourself isn’t selfish, and that sometimes we burn ourselves out thinking love and support are obligations rather than choices. the part that really landed was the reminder that “you can’t pour from an empty cup,” and it helped me stop feeling guilty for stepping back.

then i came across Clark Peacock’s Real You Chronicles series and it honestly helped me put the pieces together in a way i hadn’t before. Awaken the Real You: Manifest Like Awareness by Letting Go of Ego and Assuming the End: You Are the I AM was kind of a game changer for understanding the difference between ego and real self. one insight that really hit me was that “the false self seeks approval and overgives, the true self only witnesses and responds authentically.” like… wow, that made me see why i was constantly overextending to get validation and how awareness of that is the first step toward freedom.

the sequel, Remember The Real You, Imagined: Living in 4D, Creating in 3D, dives into how you can actually build your reality from that awareness. there’s this one thing i keep thinking about: “imagination exists in 4D and seeds the 3D world; what you choose to see and feel inside shapes the outer life you experience.” so once i started imagining myself as someone who sets boundaries without guilt and actually takes in support instead of just giving, my life started to slowly align with that inner vision. it’s wild how the first book teaches you to see clearly, and the second gives you the tools to construct from that clarity.

oh and side note, there’s this lowkey YouTube video i stumbled on about emotional depletion and overgiving, and it gave me a totally different angle on why people pull away when you stop being the “giver” by default it’s not you, it’s them being confronted with change they weren’t ready for.

and also Clark Peacock’s Manifest in Motion: Where Spiritual Power Meets Practical Progress breaks down the neuroscience behind why just knowing this isn’t enough you need your nervous system, your energy, and your actions to line up with your intention. one insight that hit me was that manifestation isn’t just wishing; it’s literally creating a state inside that matches what you want externally. that helped me stop overthinking and just start living the boundaries i needed.

so yeah… losing people after stepping into yourself sucks, no sugarcoating it. but also, this is you seeing your worth, and realizing you can finally give to yourself too. i think this space, this alone time, even the hurt—it’s actually the fertile ground for the truest, strongest version of you to grow.",1,2025-11-07T06:31:09+00:00,Negative

reddit,1ooywnl,nnb02af,Difficult-Camel-5129,e660cba9c8e0fe61,"I would say people in my life were mostly pretty actively looking for my help and I was silently resenting it deep down because I am the one who wanted to be more free from this role.

reddit,1opw9sl,nnjz53n,BakeEvery4462,f33c6ed93de2c5b2,"kinda curious first before I say anything. When you talk about that long slow grey feeling that never fully lifts, is it more like emotional flatness or more like your brain keeps slipping into that disconnected fog. I only ask because what you describe feels so familiar and I remember thinking I had tried literally everything and still felt like I was walking around underwater.

So the first book that ever gave me even a tiny mental shift was Lost Connections by Johann Hari. I found it during a weird slump. Actually wait that is not quite right. My friend left it on my kitchen table after hearing me rant for the tenth time about feeling stuck even though life looked fine on paper. It is not perfect but it got me thinking about depression in a way that did not make me feel defective. There was this idea in it about how sometimes the mind holds on to an old emotional pattern because it believes it is safer than letting go. That kinda lined up with what you said about your brain learning depression.

Then later I drifted into more internal stuff and ended up reading Clark Peacocks Real You Chronicles. The first one called Awaken the Real You Manifest Like Awareness by Letting Go of Ego and Assuming the End You Are the I AM. It surprised me. It has this thing about how the ego keeps replaying old states because it is terrified of silence. It says the ego survives by convincing you that the voice in your head is the only reality. That landed for me in a weird way. Especially during those DP DR phases where I felt like I was watching life from the outside.

Right after that I read the sequel Remember The Real You Imagined Living in 4D Creating in 3D. The way it talks about imagination is kinda wild. It says imagination sits outside time in this four dimensional space where possibilities already exist and the physical world is just the slower part that follows. There is a line about how the inner state must shift before the outer can catch up. I know it sounds woo knowing Reddit someone will probably roast me for this but it helped me realize I had been imagining sadness without meaning to. More like assuming sadness as my default identity.

The two books kinda work together. First one helped me see who I was under the noise. Second helped me understand how to create from that clearer place. Oh and also this happened to my friend too which made me feel less like I was losing it.

Side note. There is a YouTube talk by a guy who explains depression in terms of cognitive load and emotional bandwidth. I think he was a neuroscientist. Do not quote me on this. It gave me a different angle like maybe the issue is not motivation but depletion. When I watched it I remember thinking oh wow that actually explains why I felt empty even when life was going well.

And if you ever want something that mixes the spiritual with the practical Clark Peacocks Manifest in Motion is the one that did that for me. It talks about how manifestation is not just belief. It is your nervous system and your actions syncing with the state you claim you want. One part said something like desire without motion stays trapped inside you and that kinda pushed me to make tiny changes instead of trying to force giant ones.

So yeah. That is what helped me make a bit more sense of the long low fog.",2,2025-11-07T06:13:43+00:00,Negative

Understand that there is no right or wrong. You aren't stuck to one thing that you choose today. You can ALWAYS change what you're doing.

You're in a great position being financially stable. Because now you can focus on finding the thing that you would actually enjoy doing in life, and not doing something for just the money.

Here are some questions to reflect on...

1. What would you love doing whether you got paid for it or not?
2. What could you see yourself doing now that you wouldn't get bored with 10 years from now?
3. What brings you joy or excitement?
4. What do you imagine the most fun and fulfilling life would look like for you?

You're still young, so I get it - the education system teaches you certain things and ways to prepare for life. But take it from someone who's been living life outside the academic system for longer than you've been alive...

Life isn't linear. It's a messy adventure and exploration!
You can't get it wrong, because you always get another chance.
It's not about finding the ONE perfect path. It's about building a life you love and are proud of, and knowing it can and will likely change along the way.
You can get paid something you love and enjoy. You don't need to pick something that already exists - you can create things that don't exist right now, from your imagination alone! Don't get boxed in. Look outside the box to new possibilities.
You can also get paid to simply be you. So look for what lights you up, something that you want to do, not as a means of achieving something, but simply because it's fun and you want to do it. No other reason.
And remember, everything is figureoutable. If you can see it in your mind, you can hold it in your hand.

Make sure to show up for yourself. When you say youre gonna start a habit, start it. Dont lie to yourself. Just do it so you can build self trust. The more you build rhe more you build self respect and will be unshakable. 

If you put in as much or more effort for yourself as you do for others, life would be a lot easier and your confidence would skyrocket. 

When Im feeling low and about to cry I show myself the compassion I would give to a friend or partner. When I am acting out I scold myself for not realizing how tough I am and I dont need to fall into destructive habits. I, aloud, encourage myself to keep up any good work I am doing. I also take myself on little dates to celebrate good work or just when I feel like I need a friend. It felt lonely at first but now... Idk what I would do if I didnt start all this.

It feels weird talking to myself sometimes but the brain does this weird thing where the voices in the back that make me needy and scared shut up for a second and I can focus better on fixing myself.

That love and appreciation is an innate human desire to feel included, in fact, it used to and still is in a way a survival mechanism we have, because back in the day, if you didnt 'fit in' or for some reason, the others in the tribe would exclude us and possibly exile us hence hurting our chances of survival.

So long story short, everyone wants to feel loved and seen, but most of all, validated. it is our brains way of telling us we are 'on the right track' 'doing good' but it is actually 'improving our chance of survival'

Ok so what can we do with this. We are no longer in tribes, we dont have to survive like that anymore. But the feeling and desire is still there. Now we can say to our inner child something like ""i know you want to be seen, heard, loved, appreciated, but you have to know that i have always and will always take care of you in these ways, i dont need other people to give me these things, they are already within me and i will give you an abudance of it everyday because i want you to be loved""

Agreed. I take the incremental approach as that's where I have the highest likelihood of success personally. I'm ADHD and caffeine makes me worse. So that was a prime motivator for me to cut it out.

""I won't because I am not a coffee drinker.""

It happens all the time. Either that or they rushed into their lives without taking the time to really know themselves or what they want, & then years later everything falls apart because they built their lives on a weak foundation.

Do your best to focus on yourself, & have patience. You seem bright enough that I have faith you will ""figure things/yourself out"".

As a person who has spent the majority of my life struggling with addiction, the only way forward for me has been to learn all about myself, to learn what it is to be human, what that means, & learning how to cultivate that so I can grow into a new person. You might not have to go to the same lengths that I do, but if you're feeling stuck, then I highly recommend learning about yourself, whether that means spiritually, psychologically, or emotionally.  
Something I've recently come across is called ""Shadow Work."" A concept formulated by Carl Jung, that addresses your ""shadow self"" which is comprised of all the things about yourself that you've repressed in one way or another. It's pretty interesting.

Whatever you do, stop putting so much weight on what others say or think about you. & grow yourself in anyway that you can.

This might sound uncomfortable, but from my outsider perspective you’re closing the door on teaching without a better understanding of what it entails elsewhere.

I have a bunch of traumas childhood traumas that stacked up some of them small and individually we’re probably nothing but compounded with other others caused me all kinds of problems in life

I know now after several months of therapy and counselling and shadow work that my nervous system is totally fucked

It’s made me chase things that were stupid and do things that were even dumber. It’s almost got me murdered actually.

It’s caused me more harm than anything

It forced me into alcohol and drugs, which I did for decades up until 65 days ago

I’ve been clean since, but my nervous system is still rattle. I’m still tapping and erratic and behaviour and looking for other things to satisfy or soothe my nervous system because I’m not smoking I’m not drinking. I’m not doing cocaine and none of that.

I recently experienced heartbreak and job loss because my addictions got out of control or rather, they finally caught up to me

The heartbreak in combination with everything else was enough to finally snapped me out of that fake reality that I’ve been living in for I don’t know almost 30 years now

I’m proud to say again that I’m sober. I have clarity and a different understanding of reality than I did just two months ago.

My future well still bleak looks bright .. at least I hope it does

I have a plan and I’m implementing one step at a time, day by day.

I don’t want to think trauma for forgetting me here I had this plan 30 years ago. I just fell into drugs and alcohol because my suffering was too much for me to metabolize at the time. I guess I didn’t have the tools to deal with it and that shit, numbed pain and misery.

But here I am 46 almost 47 years old

Reinventing myself, rebirthing myself, rebuilding myself lol

But I knew that nobody could save me, only I could. So I started to take small steps. I started to exercise at gym and do yoga regularly. I changed my diet which I think the biggest help for my brain. I joined a club to make friends. I changed my mindset from “ I am a failure” to “ I am doing my best with the cards I dealt”. I give myself grace, love, compassion.

After 3 months, I feel much better, money and opportunities showing up unexpectedly, i made lots of friends, people are inviting me to stuff. I enrolled in yoga certification program and drivers license course. I am enjoying living. 

Am I rich? Do I have solid career? Do I have a relationship? Am I not adhd anymore? No. But I am happy, peaceful no matter what. It all starts with mindset change. You are not a failure, you are a human having an experience. So enjoy your experience. Get to know you. Take care of your body. Eat healthy, exercise. Find hobbies. Live. Watch the sunset and sunrises. Ask for help.

reddit,1opl0vt,nneo94u,EyeBallLover,745cfc9c8fa28f7b,"As another 27 year old who feels like a fuck up right now…I empathize with every word you said. 

I was always the “smart” kid. When to college. Got a doctorate/license to practice under my belt…then celebrated my 25th birthday. Recently diagnosed as OCD + ADHD and began therapy/meds…just before a series of horrible behavior/new addictions hit. I look in the mirror and don’t recognize the exhausted/uglier version of myself that I see. 

I don’t eat- but I gain weight. I was once beautiful but- like yourself- bruise myself by squeezing my body when I screw up (so odd, ik) and pull on my lashes d/t the same self-inflicted stress. I have a high stress, high income job but have been stacking debt since graduating- not paying it off. I have no rich uncles either, if you catch my drift haha. Just a beautiful, amazing husband who doesn’t know the extent of my issues (yet) and a rough game plan that feels overwhelming in and of itself. 

I drag myself to work- again, high stress- where I dump every ounce of myself that remains into the care I give/patients. That’s the only thing I have that I don’t hate about myself rn- no matter how bad it gets for me, I don’t short-change them. But that’s it. Otherwise, I’m a lazy, lying addict who didn’t even gamble until a couple months ago. I hate myself. I’m hiding some (brand new) debt from the aforementioned beautiful/amazing husband and I’ve been puking daily trying to figure out how to tell him how bad his wife sucks... He struggles with mental health and the first gambling episode I had? I panicked. Came clean. Begged him to take my cards/over the finances. He unfortunately had a panic attack in response as he stressed greatly over money and refused…so here I am. Idc about anything but hurting him right now- truly. But I also in the same breath know that I did it with- at some level- full knowledge of what I was doing. I am fighting like hell to try and hide/fix it solo, but want like hell to come clean. 

It’s hard. Life IS hard. Regardless of brainpower, money, good things coming your way- whatever. Idk why we are this way- but I wanted to emphasize the WE to you. You aren’t awful. You aren’t “bad.” You aren’t even unique in your struggles. Here’s hoping/praying we can work towards betterment- if not for ourselves, the people around us. 

I don’t quite believe it myself, yet, but my therapist keeps swearing that I deserve happiness/good things. That I need to love myself like I love my husband/others (as they’re the only reason I have any desire to even fix my life). If she says that to someone as awful as me- I’m certain she’s say even kinder things to you. 

And for what it’s worth, I believe the people who said you were clever growing up. Being intelligent is a curse for almost all of those who are- historically speaking. Find any “genius” in history who you admire and they (almost) all have some well-documented vice. They also all had bouts of depression/lack of understanding of what the point is. Why do we even sit on this damn rock and try so hard just to in turn create problems for ourselves and others no matter how hard we try? We have complete autonomy, yet I feel so useless and hopeless so often…It’s frustrating. 

People that aren’t as intelligent often have peace for a reason: they don’t know what to question, what to fear or how to begin to recognize shitty patterns (in themselves or in the world) in the capacity you or I do. It sucks. But we’re smart- we need to act like it. Sending love and prayers/thoughts/vibes (whatever lol) through a phone screen. Know you are not alone.

reddit,1oo99qp,nn7fq3j,BakeEvery4462,f33c6ed93de2c5b2,"Yo I really felt that post… it’s crazy how much our brains feed off chaos without us even noticing. Like I used to think being “informed” meant watching the news every morning and keeping up with whatever dark documentary was trending, but it was just wrecking my mood. Reading what you wrote actually reminded me of when I first started pulling myself out of that cycle.

There’s this book I stumbled across back then called *The Untethered Soul* by Michael Singer. It sounds kinda cliché, I know, but it honestly hit different. He talks about how your mind keeps replaying pain like an old song on loop, and the real freedom comes from noticing the noise instead of fighting it. That was the first time I realized how addicted I was to my own inner drama.

Then a while later I found this series that tied everything together for me, the *Real You Chronicles* by Clark Peacock. The first one, *Awaken the Real You: Manifest Like Awareness by Letting Go of Ego and Assuming the End*, was like this aha moment. I started seeing that my “reactive self” wasn’t actually me at all, it was just the ego trying to feel safe through control and noise. There’s a part where he says something like how the ego survives by convincing you that peace is boring, and man that hit hard. Once that clicked, I stopped confusing stillness with emptiness.

The sequel, *Remember The Real You, Imagined: Living in 4D, Creating in 3D*, goes even deeper. It basically shows how imagination is the bridge between inner awareness and outer reality. Like, awareness is who you are, imagination is how you move energy. He says something along the lines of “you don’t manifest by reaching forward in time, you do it by remembering what’s already true in the unseen dimension.” Sounds trippy but it makes sense when you sit with it. The two books kinda work like vision and creation. One helps you see clearly, the other helps you build with what you see.

Actually wait, that’s not quite right… it’s more like the first book wakes you up and the second teaches you to dream consciously. If that makes sense? Anyway, it matched a lot with what you said about being addicted to chaos. Because once I stopped feeding my ego pain, I realized my imagination had been hijacked by fear the whole time.

Oh and also, if you’re into videos, there’s this short talk by Alan Watts called “The Mind is a Hoax” that really clicked for me when I was going through a similar shift. He talks about how we mistake our thoughts for reality, and when we stop identifying with them, life gets weirdly light. I think it’s on YouTube somewhere.

So yeah, I love that you’re sharing your progress. It’s actually inspiring to see people take action instead of just talk about it. Keep going with the “happy entertainment” thing, it’s not just fluff, it literally rewires your nervous system over time. I didn’t believe it either until my whole vibe started changing… and then people around me changed too. Funny how that works, huh?",3,2025-11-05T08:31:18+00:00,Positive

reddit,1ooszdw,nn7fuiw,BakeEvery4462,f33c6ed93de2c5b2,"Dude I actually love how you explained that, the whole “real self vs ideal self” thing. It makes total sense. Like when I was reading your post I kept thinking yeah… that’s literally the ego fighting to stay in control. You nailed it with how the mind creates this fantasy version of yourself to balance out the self-hate, because the ego can’t stand feeling small. It’s kinda wild when you realize that both the superiority and the self-loathing come from the same root.

I remember being in that same headspace a few years ago, just hating myself but also secretly thinking no one really “got it” like I did. It’s weird to admit but it’s true. Then I found this book *The Mountain Is You* by Brianna Wiest, and it flipped something in my brain. She talks about how self-sabotage is just your pain trying to protect you. Like, you’re not broken, you’re just repeating what made you feel safe once. That line hit me so hard I had to put the book down for a sec.

Then later I came across this series that basically built on that idea, *The Real You Chronicles* by Clark Peacock. The first one, *Awaken the Real You: Manifest Like Awareness by Letting Go of Ego and Assuming the End*, completely changed how I saw myself. It was like, “oh wait… I’m not the voice in my head judging everything, I’m the awareness hearing it.” There’s this part where he says something like, the ego isn’t bad, it’s just scared, pretending to be you so it doesn’t disappear. That messed me up in the best way. Once I saw that, I could actually feel compassion for the parts of me I used to hate.

Then the sequel, *Remember The Real You, Imagined: Living in 4D, Creating in 3D*, kind of expanded the whole thing. It’s about how your imagination lives in 4D, where time and space don’t exist, and everything you “become” in your mind eventually filters into 3D reality. Basically, what you assume as true in that inner world eventually gets built in this one. There’s this one line that stuck with me, something like, “Creation isn’t about forcing change, it’s about remembering the version of you that already exists beyond time.” Once I got that, it connected perfectly to what Rogers said. The “ideal self” isn’t fake, it’s just trapped in 4D waiting for you to see through the ego noise.

Actually wait, that’s not quite it… it’s more like you stop chasing the ideal self and start remembering you already are it underneath all the survival mechanisms. So yeah, your post really ties into that whole process of collapsing the distance between who you *think* you are and who you actually *are.*

Oh and side note, there’s this old Alan Watts video called “The Mind vs The Self” on YouTube that hit me in the same way. He talks about how the self-hatred loop is literally the ego arguing with itself, and awareness is just sitting there, quietly watching the show. It’s kind of comforting when you realize you don’t have to fix the voices, just stop identifying with them.

Anyway, I really liked your take on it. You’re not far off at all. It’s like, once you stop making war between the real and ideal, they actually start to merge… and that’s when peace sneaks in quietly, like it was always there the whole time.",5,2025-11-05T08:32:32+00:00,Negative

Hidden gem. 

She writes about *The Idealized Image.* 

Here’s an excerpt. It’s full of gems and perfectly captures what you’re saying. It’s from 1945.

*If the neurotic’s interest lies in convincing himself that he is his idealized image, he develops the belief that he is in fact the mastermind, the exquisite human being, whose very faults are divine.
If the focus is on the realistic self which by comparison with the idealized image is highly despicable, self-derogatory criticism is in the foreground. Since the picture of the self that results from such disparagement is just as far removed from reality as is the idealized image, it could appropriately be called the despised image.*



*If, finally, the focus is upon the discrepancy between the idealized image and the actual self, then all he is aware of and all we can observe are his incessant attempts to bridge the gap and whip himself into perfection. In this event he keeps reiterating the word “should” with amazing frequency. He keeps telling us what he should have felt, thought, done. He is at bottom as convinced of his inherent perfection as the naively “narcissistic” person, and betrays it by the belief that he actually could be perfect if only he were more strict with himself, more controlled, more alert, more circumspect.*",2,2025-11-05T15:25:46+00:00,Negative

1. ""Depression can't hit a moving target"" - I walked, walked and walked. I'd make it 'more exciting' by finding new walking routes, mapping them out and marking the day at which I would go on my calendar. Plenty on social media! I even walked along some tube lines. When I was feeling a bit better after a few months, I started going for group fitness classes. Mostly something that got my focus away from me and my problems.
2. Volunteer. I volunteered in soup kitchens. It gave me purpose and people around me to chat to that didnt know me or judge me for my past. They were strangers but kept me occupied on nights I would otherwise be alone crying in my room.
3. Role play. I would go to new places pretending to be someone else. Sounds ridiculous. But I was unemployed for a couple of months due to redundancy - I got dressed up and walked in the City along the big shiny offices where I used to work and got a take away coffee. It felt good to be back in those shoes. I would sometimes get dressed up to go for watch the theatre pretending the entire time in my head like I was someone else. In the worse of times, I would strike up conversations with baristas, or anyone really about a whole other 'life'- 'oh I'm just on my way to meet an old friend from high school', etc. For a brief moment, I wasn't me, and that was such a relief.

The goal was to move, find purpose, and keep the focus away from oneself and its issues. Good luck.",226,2025-11-04T16:23:30+00:00,Negative

reddit,1oob9uu,nn38kuv,didntask-com,cad033bb3ca57587,"Something that has been crucial in me preventing depressive episodes and burnout was to get into the habit of getting my thoughts out there. 

I believe our minds are like a glass under a tap of constantly running water. If you don't empty the water out from the glass before it reaches the top, it will overflow and make a mess everywhere. 

In the same way that if we aren't regularly emptying our thoughts from our mind, we run the risk of them overflowing and making a mess (aka depression/burnout). And unlike the glass under the tap, we can't see when our thoughts are about to overflow. This is why burnout/depression tends to come at the worst and most unexpected times. 

There are a few ways to get your thoughts out there such as journaling, solo walks, or sitting in front of a mirror talking.

When doing this, aim to say exactly what is on your mind, even if it's something you're embarrassed, ashamed, or in denial about. Because of this, I've found it essential to always follow 2 rules when self reflecting:

1. Address the elephant in the room first and foremost 
2. Never lie to yourself

Addressing the elephant in the room first is important as not doing so whilst addressing something else is like cleaning up the spilled cereal whilst your house is on fire. Until it's addressed, it will always be there, gnawing at you until you can't ignore it anymore, for which you will have no choice but to do what you should've done a long time ago: talk about it.

As for lying to yourself, you can lie to your friends, family, partners, etc but you should never lie to yourself. Nothing good will ever come from it. Plus, I'm a strong believer in that it's impossible to lie to yourself as you have to know something to be true first in order for you to be in denial about it in the first place.",10,2025-11-04T17:39:13+00:00,Negative

1) Usually, a depression is being confronted with the expectations you have, but they are not being met. You are sick of the situation you're in and don't see an easy way out. Life sucks because it's not the life you want, and you know what to do to make it better, but it's insanely demanding to create what you want.

And 2) Feeling like shit, usually comes from bad habits. You're not sleeping 8 hours, you're eating garbage all the time, you drink smoke and drug, you're not doing workouts, you're not stretching, you're staring at screens for 10-12 hours a day, etc etc etc. Fix those bad habits! Get out there, walk, eat a banana, go to the gym 3 times a week, have a fresh haircut, minimize or stop drinking and smoking for a while, take 10 minutes a day to stretch that body, etc etc etc!

It’s not easy to learn discipline and build healthy habits/routines. Make a commitment to it in some way and get someone to hold you accountable for it. Remind yourself of the reasons why you want to do it and focus on the benefits and positive aspects.

reddit,1ooxz98,nna4opt,searchingforubik,448b83dd079732f0,"I feel this.  I got divorced like ... 7-8 years ago now, after a year of stupid stuff I got into a really good morning routine, woke up at 7, took vitamins and then ran 2 miles M/W/F or did bodyweight exercises a bit.  Got in really good shape, did that for a year and a half got in another relationship and then it went out the window after 6 months.  I keep trying to get a morning routine back now and for whatever reason am having a hard time with the discipline/consistency.  The thing I will say, running 3 times a week really really made me feel good (mentally), idk what it was but knowing I started the day off with the shittiest part of my day just made the rest of the day way more better and I felt like I at least accomplished my own goal.  I'm working right now to try and get that back.  Hope you figure something out that works for you.  It's definitely a doable thing.  To more solidly answer your question, I think at the beginning it was just discipline and not wanting to be like, stuck in a rut anymore.  Over time though it felt like momentum had built and I was doing something I was in charge of and sticking to and it felt really good to be able to hold myself accountable.  I think it's discipline in the beginning then once you get in a groove and have some time with it actually being done, it legitimately builds momentum where you don't wanna miss it.  Idk, I know everybody's different but it definitely becomes easier over time especially if you acknowledge the good things that you did while doing it.  I don't think motivation is a thing that happens until after you start doing it to be completely honest.

Some things that have worked for me are:

turning it off when you need to get something done, and not allowing yourself to turn it back on UNTIL you get what you need done, done, no matter how long that takes.

Deleting social media apps, forcing you to only use the PC browser versions of each.

Deactivating social media accounts temporarily, allowing your brain to reset from them.

Replacing your social media or phone game habit with something like the Bible app. Obviously this would be if you’re Christian, but you could also use Audible or Kindle or something similar, as it forces you to read or listen to audiobooks, rather than just scrolling on social media or reels. Meditation apps can also help. Work out apps too. Whatever works for you, just as long as it’s not social media or YouTube.",3,2025-11-05T04:05:47+00:00,Positive
reddit,1oospbh,nn7g9cn,BakeEvery4462,f33c6ed93de2c5b2,"yo I totally get this. I went through the exact same loop in college, like knowing I *wanted* to focus but still ending up scrolling until 3am wondering where the hell the day went. it’s not even laziness, it’s like your brain’s reward system got hijacked and now everything offline feels dull.

I remember reading this book called *Stolen Focus* by Johann Hari when I was deep in that phase, and it was such a wake up call. he talks about how our attention isn’t just about willpower, it’s about environment and how tech is literally designed to keep us in that dopamine drip. it made me realize I wasn’t broken, I was just playing a game where the odds were stacked against me.

around that time I also found *Awaken the Real You: Manifest Like Awareness by Letting Go of Ego and Assuming the End* by Clark Peacock. it’s free on Kindle Unlimited btw. it hit me in a more spiritual way, like not just “my phone’s distracting me” but “I forgot who’s actually behind the screen.” there’s this one part that says something like the ego feeds on stimulation because silence exposes its emptiness. that line messed me up a little because it made me realize how much I used my phone to avoid being alone with my own thoughts.

the sequel *Remember The Real You, Imagined: Living in 4D, Creating in 3D* tied it together for me. it talks about how imagination is where creation starts, and the physical world just catches up. it’s like, the 4D is where you live internally first, then the 3D adjusts to match. so when I started imagining myself being focused, like actually feeling that version of me, it slowly started to happen. not instantly, but it shifted the way I saw myself.

actually wait, that’s not quite right, it wasn’t about forcing myself to be productive, it was about remembering that the calm, focused part of me was *already there*, under all the noise. I think that’s what changed everything, cause when you come from awareness instead of guilt, your habits kinda align naturally.

oh and side note, I watched this short talk by Andrew Huberman about dopamine cycles, where he explains how you can reset your reward system by spending a day without digital input. like no phone, no YouTube, nothing. it sounded brutal but I tried it once and it’s wild how quiet your brain gets after the panic wears off.

so yeah, it’s not that you lack motivation. your system’s just fried from overstimulation. the goal isn’t to force discipline but to find that stillness underneath the noise. once you get a taste of that, scrolling stops being as tempting.",2,2025-11-05T08:36:44+00:00,Negative

reddit,1oovfu8,nn7gg8u,BakeEvery4462,f33c6ed93de2c5b2,"oh man I felt this one deep. that cycle of going all in, then burning out, then hating yourself for not keeping it up… been there like way too many times. it’s such a weird mix of hope and exhaustion right? like you get this spark, and it feels so real in the moment, and then suddenly everything crashes and you’re just staring at your messy room again wondering where the energy went.

I was in that space last year actually. I picked up *Atomic Habits* by James Clear and yeah I know everyone recommends it, but the part that really landed for me was how he talks about identity-based habits. basically instead of “I want to be motivated,” you start thinking “what would a grounded person do?” and you just do tiny consistent stuff that matches that. it sounds simple but for me it kinda changed the tone from “fix your life now” to “just become someone who does this naturally.”

but honestly, what pulled everything together for me were these two books I found by Clark Peacock. the first one’s *Awaken the Real You: Manifest Like Awareness by Letting Go of Ego and Assuming the End*. it’s on Amazon KDP, free on Kindle Unlimited if you got that. I didn’t expect much at first but it actually hit different. it talks about how ego is the voice that needs results fast and awareness is the part of you that’s just steady, patient, already complete. there’s this one line that stuck with me, something like “the ego tries to achieve peace by doing, awareness creates peace by being.” that clicked so hard. I realized I was living in these short bursts because I was chasing the feeling of being enough instead of starting from it.

then I read the sequel *Remember The Real You, Imagined: Living in 4D, Creating in 3D*. that one builds on it but in a super trippy practical way. it explains that your imagination exists in this 4D layer where everything already exists, and the 3D world is just catching up to it. so instead of forcing change, you start aligning with what’s already real in imagination. one idea was that “you don’t chase discipline, you imagine yourself as someone who already moves with ease.” and I swear when I started doing that, my habits stopped feeling like chores and more like remembering who I already was.

so I guess for me it stopped being about managing motivation and became about managing *identity*. like awareness first, imagination second. once you stop seeing yourself as someone who needs to constantly prove or fix, the doing part actually feels lighter.

oh and there’s this short talk on YouTube by Alan Watts called “The Mind and the Habit of Control.” I think that’s the name? don’t quote me. it’s only like 10 minutes but it’s basically him saying that life organizes itself better when you stop micromanaging every wave. I watched it during a walk one night and it just… softened everything.

anyway, I think what helps most is remembering that motivation is a state, not a lifestyle. awareness and imagination, those are more sustainable. the first one keeps you steady, the second one keeps you inspired. the rest just follows at its own pace.",1,2025-11-05T08:38:42+00:00,Positive

Then you add on another thing onto your ritual, and you do the same thing over again, do it for like 60 days before you add on another thing.

Making big changes is always gonna fail because it relies on motivation and will power which is a FINITE SOURCE. When motivation and will power fades, your attempt at change collapses. 

I am over 60+ days in waking up to cold showers every day. It's ritual, I don't even think about it.  I'm about to add on my next task to solidify into ritual.",1,2025-11-05T20:54:37+00:00,Negative
reddit,1oovfu8,nn7f2tf,ryan-rmrz,7344fa3f72db8357,"Yeah, good catch. This approach is unsustainable and ineffective (from a psychological standpoint).

When you rely on will power or motivation, you have a limit on its usefulness or output. You can do something intense or difficult only for so long, as the body and mind aren't designed to be under such intense strain for long periods of time.

This is the reason why the body creates habits - to conserve energy and effort over the long run. And why the mind creates beliefs (just thought habits).

Sustainability comes from a different understanding and mindset. Understanding how habits are formed and how they are sustained is key.

Here's how...

You have to shift from the mindset of 'all-or-nothing' to the mindset of 'consistency-before-intensity'.

Lasting change comes by reducing the thing you do to a ridiculous level.

For example, if you wanted to do 100 pushups a day, and attempted it with the 'all-or-nothing mindset', you may be able to do it once or twice, or maybe even for an entire week or two, but eventually, you will halt to doing nothing again.

The 'consistency-before-intensity' mindset would look like this instead... doing 1 pushup a day for 20 days.

Now, the default mindset will think, ""that's so ridiculous!!! What's that going to do? How will that change anything?!"" And that's the trap to bring it back to being intense and unsustainable again.

Hear me out, because our new process isn't complete yet. Once you've done 1 pushup for 20 days (which is super easy because it's such a ridiculously low rep), you move up to 5 pushups a day for the next 20 days.

What's happening as you do this?

1. You're practicing consistency by doing it daily.
2. It's building a habit in an effortlessly (and sustainable) way.
3. Psychologically (to the mind), it's so easy that it's actually ridiculous if it doesn't complete it, increasing the probability of taking the action.
4. The successful completion each day cultivates a succeeding mentality rather than a failing mentality.
5. Your confidence increases as you start to trust yourself more, to follow through in what you say you're going to do.

After the 20 days of 5 pushups, you increase it to 10 for the next 20 days.

REMEMBER: we're going for CONSISTENCY here, NOT INTENSITY. So be cautious of the mind to try jumping to 20 or something higher too quickly.

We will get there.

What helped my tendency to want to go more intense early on was, to have my MUST DO or my BASELINE (what I consider as a ✅ for that day) be 1 pushup. And whilst I'm down there, if I wanted to do more, I would, but it has no bearing on my success for that day. Tomorrow, I would still ONLY need to do 1 pushup.

Make sense?

So, try this out and let us know how sustainable this is for you ☺️👍 You've got this! 💪",0,2025-11-05T08:24:51+00:00,Positive

reddit,1ooh880,nn50dln,turdus_rufiventris,9dfb5ff563022144,"Three key points: imitation, thoughtfulness, and self-assuredness.
**Imitation** is how we learn to do anything, especially socialize, since the moment we are born. It's not uncommon to have to or choose to repeat that step further into adolescence/adulthood. Pay attention to the people you like. How do they interact with the world? How do they greet others, engage in polite conversation, joke around, ask for things? 


**Tips for this step:**


• Everyone has a different way of doing these things, so instead of looking for a universal constant, focus on how the people you like or look up to. That way, you won't go through the painful process of trying to be someone you don't want to be in order to be liked. You also will attract the exact kind of people you imitate.


• This is crucial: **do not** imitate people from TV shows, movies, skits, or even social media. These are all performances and, while they can be entertaining to watch, they are usually *not* fun to be around. Focus on real people in your day to day life.


**Thoughtfulness** is another thing I've seen mentioned in the comments already. Try to slow down and pause before your actions and comments. This is a very effective way of preventing impulsive words or actions that we regret immediately after because they may be awkward, insensitive, or inappropriate. It also serves as a way to compose yourself if you struggle with being too intense in social settings.


**Tips for this step:**


• Think twice before you speak and act. Ask yourself: what reaction will this get from people? Is it what you want to accomplish? Is there a way in which this could be hurtful, insensitive, or irritating? If so, what is a better alternative?


• Always look for the kinder option rather than the cooler, smarter, or funnier option. Social blunders are much, much easier to overlook if they come from a place of genuine care for others. Worst case scenario, people will usually think you're sweet if a little misguided; with the other three options, the worst case scenario is people thinking you're obnoxious or a douche.


• Don't be overtly familiar with people whom you haven't known for very long. This includes touching them physically, giving unsolicited advice, and jokingly making fun of them if they haven't done the same for you.


And lastly, **self-assuredness.** It's hard not to look for validation in others when we lack it. But socialization is not a game to be won: always looking for the right thing to say, the right way to appear and the perfect solution to be liked will make socialization hell for you and the people you're interacting with. The only way to get people to like you is to be sincere with the parts that make up your personality.


**Tips for this step:**


• Thoughtfulness does a lot for our confidence, as it is a lot easier to be sure of our actions if they're what we've decided is the best course of action instead of the first thing that comes to mind.


• Don't sweat the small stuff. Everyone makes social blunders; most people don't keep a log on them. If you ever feel like you did something cringe or stupid, breathe and remember that people don't care or will stop caring in about five seconds. If you feel like you did something *seriously* socially inappropriate, stop and address your mistake with something quick like ""Wait, that was kinda obnoxious/insensitive/mean/rude, sorry"", perhaps clear up what you meant, and move on. Others will move on too.


• Figure out the things you like about yourself, what is fun for you, and what is important to you. Use those as tools to connect with people. Conversely, pay attention to what the people you like consider fun and important. Find common ground where there is, and try to create it where there isn't (for example, by playing someone's favorite videogame or listening to their music recommendations).


Lastly, **practice makes perfect!** The more you socialize, the easier it becomes. Some of these things may be difficult or stiff at first, but with time they become natural and instinctive. You'd be surprised at the difference that comes with time and repeatedly putting yourself out there.",1,2025-11-04T22:42:15+00:00,Negative

It’s weird how being self aware doesn’t actually make you feel more in control, it just makes you notice every tiny thing you do wrong in HD. I used to overthink every word that came out of my mouth, like I’d replay convos in my head for hours thinking “why did I laugh like that” or “why did I say that stupid thing.” The cringe spiral is brutal.

What helped me a lot was this book called *The Subtle Art of Not Giving a F*ck\* by Mark Manson. It’s kinda loud and funny but real too. He talks about how trying too hard to be liked actually makes people feel disconnected from you. Like the more you *try* not to be cringe, the more you are, because you’re moving from this fake version of yourself. That actually hit me cause I realized my “trying to fit in” self was just a scared version of me putting on armor.

Then later I read *Awaken the Real You: Manifest Like Awareness by Letting Go of Ego and Assuming the End* by Clark Peacock. It’s free on Kindle Unlimited and it honestly flipped something in me. It’s not about manifestation like wishful thinking, it’s more about awareness. There’s this part that says something like “the ego only feels cringe when it believes it can be judged.” That made me sit there for a sec, like wow. Because yeah, who’s actually doing the judging inside? Once you see it’s your own ego looping back on itself, it kinda loses power.

The sequel, *Remember The Real You, Imagined: Living in 4D, Creating in 3D*, goes even deeper. It’s about how imagination exists in 4D, and everything physical is just the echo of that. There’s this line that stuck with me, “Reality bends to the confidence of the unseen self.” I think what makes someone come off as cringe or not is really just that confidence mismatch. When you’re being playful but unsure, people sense it. But when you’re playful and *aware*, like you’re in on the joke of being human, it suddenly feels magnetic instead of weird.

Actually wait, that’s not quite right, it’s not about “fixing” yourself. It’s more like relaxing into yourself. Once you stop trying to edit your personality mid-conversation, you’ll notice people start responding differently. They mirror your comfort level without even realizing it.

Oh and also, side note, there’s this short Alan Watts video on YouTube called “Stop Trying to Be Yourself.” It’s hilarious and weirdly freeing. He talks about how trying to be authentic is just another disguise, cause your real self doesn’t need to try.

So yeah, you’re not broken or cringey, you’re just in that awkward middle stage between awareness and full acceptance. Everyone goes through that.

Only worry about what you can control,  you can't control what someone else thinks of you.  Even when you think you're doing everything right,  someone else might not agree because they have a different perspective and experience of the world.  Comparison is the thief of joy,  and if you are comparing yourself to arbitrary social expectations you'll have a bad time.  

Yea all this is easier said than done,  but just start by catching yourself thinking negatively, and reframe it to the opposite. It's not ""I'm upsetting this person because i stood too close and now they think I'm weird"" it's ""i don't know what they are thinking,  but anyways I can't worry about what I can't control"" 

I could go on and on about this subject, but I used to care more than anything what people were thinking about me,  how I am perceived, seeking external validation etc etc. You actually have to practice not caring so much at first and kind of forcing yourself to give people the benefit of the doubt even if you think you absolutely know what they are thinking about you.  And ask yourself; what is the worst case scenario anyways? That they tell me to fuck off? I've lived through worse haha. It helps to think of the craziest worst case scenario too because then you realize how much you're overreacting. Ok so I was told to fuck off. Then what? Absolutely nothing.

What works best for me is having an idea about all of the things that I want to get done over at least the next 2 days. When I’m up early or late, I journal about my plans. It doesn’t matter what time of day I do it, just that I do. I track not drinking alcohol, walking 3 miles, and strength training with a habit tracking app so I can monitor consistency. If I have dishes or laundry to do, I do it while my coffee is brewing. Everything else is just get done by 3:45 and shower before hubby gets home, cook dinner, do dishes, chill. I’m doing house projects currently so that’s my primary focus. If I don’t get something done, it’s usually because something took too long or I needed a break; no shame, something just gets pushed to the next day.",3,2025-11-05T01:24:54+00:00,Positive

I found this book called *The Practice* by Seth Godin that helped me reframe the whole thing. it’s about creating consistency not from motivation but from devotion. he says something like you don’t wait for inspiration, you build a system that lets inspiration find you. I started treating my mornings like that, less “I need to fix myself,” more “this is my little daily ritual.” actually wait, that sounds kinda corny, but you get it.

then around that same time I read *Awaken the Real You: Manifest Like Awareness by Letting Go of Ego and Assuming the End* by Clark Peacock. it’s free on Kindle Unlimited if you have it. that one hit deeper, more spiritual but still grounded. he talks about how ego’s always chasing purpose outside of you, but awareness just moves from peace. there’s this one line stuck with me, something like “discipline isn’t control, it’s remembrance.” that’s wild right? it made me see that half my burnout was coming from trying to *become* someone instead of remembering I already was that person when I’m present.

and the sequel *Remember The Real You, Imagined: Living in 4D, Creating in 3D* kinda takes it to another level. it’s like once you reconnect with who you are, imagination becomes this quiet compass. he explains how the inner world (the 4D) is the blueprint, and the 3D is just catching up to it. so instead of “I need motivation,” you start imagining from the end, like you already are the version of you that wakes up clear and calm. it weirdly takes pressure off. one thing he said that hit was that “consistency happens naturally when the future you’re living in feels more real than the past you’re running from.” I’ve been thinking about that ever since.

so now when I fall off routine, I don’t freak out. I just re-align. I try to see it like tuning a guitar, not breaking one. oh and side note, there’s this short talk by Andrew Huberman (the neuroscience guy) where he explains how small wins literally rewire your dopamine cycle. not a motivational thing, just pure brain stuff. I think it’s called “The Science of Consistency” or something like that, it’s on YouTube.

anyway, I think the trick isn’t chasing the old high school drive again. it’s finding something smaller but more sacred. once you know who’s showing up to the routine (the real you, not the ego that needs to perform), it starts feeling less like a chore and more like something you *get* to do. and those days you fall off? they stop feeling like failure, just a reminder to start fresh again tomorrow.",3,2025-11-05T08:39:34+00:00,Positive

Everything you described makes sense — your body learned to associate winter with fear and loneliness, so of course the season feels heavy now. It’s not something you just “snap out of.” There is a name for this is it called Seasonal depression Disorder, I have covered this in a couple of blogs if you would like to check them out. 

One gentle approach that can really help is to **build new, tiny rituals** that belong only to *you*, so your brain can start forming new associations. Things like:

* A warm drink you make every morning in winter
* Soft lighting (fairy lights, warm lamps) to fight the darkness
* A specific comfort show or playlist every evening
* Wearing your colorful clothes as *intentional armor* against the season
* One weekly check-in with someone safe, even online

Focus on **sensory comfort**: soft textures, cozy blankets, warm food, familiar scents. It’s about making your environment feel *consistently safe*, even in small ways.

You don’t have to love winter — you just deserve to feel *held* by it instead of overwhelmed. Small, gentle steps are enough.",2,2025-11-05T15:11:32+00:00,Negative

reddit,1oov29s,nn7g5w6,BakeEvery4462,f33c6ed93de2c5b2,"yo I really felt this one. like that exact “I’m doing everything right but still don’t know who I am or where I’m going” feeling hits hard. it’s like you fix your body, your routine, maybe even your environment but your soul’s just standing there going “now what?” I was in that same space around 24, no real direction, just this constant low hum of “I’m not enough.”

there’s this book I found kinda by accident called *The Mountain Is You* by Brianna Wiest, and it weirdly shifted things for me. she talks about how self sabotage is actually self protection, like you’re not broken, you’re just scared of outgrowing what’s familiar. that idea stuck with me cause I realized I wasn’t lazy or stupid, I was just protecting myself from change I didn’t feel ready for yet.

actually wait, that reminds me of another series that tied it all together for me. it’s called *The Real You Chronicles* by Clark Peacock, and the first one, *Awaken the Real You: Manifest Like Awareness by Letting Go of Ego and Assuming the End*, hit different. it’s free on Kindle Unlimited btw. it helped me see that the voice calling me stupid or behind was literally not me. like it said something along the lines of “ego builds a prison and then blames you for being locked inside.” I remember reading that and just sitting there like damn… that’s what I’ve been doing.

then the sequel *Remember The Real You, Imagined: Living in 4D, Creating in 3D* took that even further. it’s about how imagination isn’t just fantasy, it’s literally the blueprint for what becomes real. it talks about how “the 4D is the world you feel before it appears, and the 3D just catches up to what you’ve already believed.” that part made me stop trying to figure my life out from logic and start feeling into what I actually wanted to experience, even if I didn’t know the steps yet.

so I started small, like imagining myself not scared of driving instead of forcing myself to do it. and weirdly, the fear kinda softened. it’s like your mind needs to experience safety in imagination before your body can trust it in real life.

oh and also, there’s this short video I saw that helped when I felt directionless, it was Alan Watts talking about “what would you do if money were no object.” yeah I know everyone’s heard it but when I watched it while feeling stuck it hit completely different. it made me realize how much of what I thought I wanted was just me trying to prove I wasn’t dumb or behind.

anyway, I don’t think you’re stupid. sounds more like you’re burnt out from having to survive too long without ever getting to *build* something that’s actually yours. you’re in the rebuilding phase, not the failure one. and that’s a really brave place to be, even if it feels slow.",4,2025-11-05T08:35:44+00:00,Negative

I kept asking, “am I real or just a version of me I think people will like?”

funny enough, a book that sorta cracked something open for me was *The Untethered Soul* by Michael Singer. it’s not perfect but it hit at the right time. the idea that you’re not your thoughts or the mask, you’re the one noticing them. it sounds cliché at first, but when it clicks, it’s like oh… so all this anxiety about who I’m supposed to be is actually coming from the wrong place entirely.

and then later I stumbled across *Awaken the Real You: Manifest Like Awareness by Letting Go of Ego and Assuming the End* by Clark Peacock (it’s on Amazon, free if you’ve got Kindle Unlimited). it goes deeper into that same realization, just more practical somehow. it helped me see that the “fake” feeling comes from identifying with the ego, not from who you actually are. there’s this line that stuck with me, something like how the ego is a voice trying to keep you safe, not true. and when you stop trying to fix or improve that voice, you start to hear what’s *under* it, which is just awareness. pure, still, you. that shifted a lot for me.

actually wait, I’m mixing up a bit, because the sequel *Remember The Real You, Imagined: Living in 4D, Creating in 3D* picks up from there. that one talks about imagination not as fantasy but as this creative field, like 4D consciousness shaping 3D reality. sounds trippy but the idea is once you know who you are (awareness), you can start to create from that instead of fear or performance. there’s a part where it says reality isn’t something you find, it’s something you remember through the imagination of who you’ve already become. I don’t know why but that just made so much sense after years of trying to “be” someone.

what I got from both books is like, stop trying to manufacture authenticity. it’s not something you do, it’s what’s left when you stop pretending. and pretending isn’t even bad, it’s just outdated protection. the “you” underneath has been here all along, watching.

oh and also, when I was stuck in that identity spiral I found this random YouTube talk by Alan Watts, “The Mind is a Hoax.” sounds dramatic but it really lined up with the awareness thing. he basically says you can’t figure out how to be yourself because the one trying to figure it out *isn’t* you. something about that gave me permission to stop analyzing and just... be in the moment for once.

so yeah, I think part of being yourself is realizing you’ve never actually stopped. you just forgot what that feels like under all the “shoulds.” knowing Reddit someone will probably say the same thing but less poetic haha, but seriously, you’re not fake. you’re just tired of performing. and that’s honestly the beginning of the real you waking up.",2,2025-11-05T08:41:39+00:00,Negative

Then one day, they wake up just like you did, scared, anxious, and aware that no one’s coming to save them. That’s actually the moment where your real life starts. You’re not stuck, you’re just undertrained. You’ve been in survival mode, not growth mode. That’s why you feel numb. You’ve been reacting to life instead of building one. But here’s what you do now. Pick one skill. Not ten, not five, just one. Something that can get you paid and move you closer to freedom. It could be coding, sales, design, content creation, anything that aligns with your energy. Then give it 12 months of focus. No distractions, no doubting. Just commit.

And stop thinking “what can I do in one year.” You can change your entire life in one year if you actually lock in. I’ve seen people go from broke and lost to six figures in less than 12 months simply because they finally got serious. As for the panic attack, that’s your body screaming that you’re not living in alignment. It’s not weakness. It’s a warning. Use that fear as fuel.

Then, work backwards - what would it take for you to feel appreciated? What would it take for you to feel financially secure?  Write it down.  Then work backwards again all the way to, what is the first thing I can do for myself so I can build towards that feeling.  And then do it. 

Continue to dabble as a means to explore. Take on more work, volunteer, network. Just put yourself out there and commit to working towards the feeling you want to achieve. The world if full of opportunities and sometimes you have to try on a few of them to see what fits best.

reddit,1oo49wk,nn7gcsx,BakeEvery4462,f33c6ed93de2c5b2,"man I really feel that. like that weird ache that comes from realizing time passed and you weren’t really *living*, just kind of existing. I went through something similar around 25 and it’s wild how those years feel heavier in hindsight, like you’re supposed to have figured life out by now but somehow you just… didn’t. when you mentioned that panic attack thing, I got chills cause the same thing happened to me one night out of nowhere. it’s like your body just hits that wall of “I can’t keep going like this.”

when I was in that headspace, I picked up *The Mountain Is You* by Brianna Wiest. I wasn’t expecting much but it kinda hit home. she talks about how self-sabotage is just a form of self-protection, like your brain clings to what’s familiar even when it sucks because it’s scared of what comes next. it helped me stop seeing myself as lazy or lost and start seeing it as me being scared to fail differently.

around that time I also stumbled into *Awaken the Real You: Manifest Like Awareness by Letting Go of Ego and Assuming the End* by Clark Peacock. it’s free on Kindle Unlimited, and honestly, that book hit a deeper layer for me. it talks about how the ego builds this fake sense of time where you believe you’ve “wasted” years, but awareness exists outside of that. there’s this part where he says something like the past doesn’t define you, it only delays you when you keep rehearsing it. I started realizing I wasn’t behind, I was just replaying an identity that already expired.

then the sequel *Remember The Real You, Imagined: Living in 4D, Creating in 3D* kinda flipped how I saw progress. it’s all about imagination being the real creative space, and how the physical just catches up later. like, the 3D world moves slower than the 4D vision. so when you start seeing yourself differently on the inside, everything else eventually syncs. that actually gave me a weird kind of peace cause I stopped expecting overnight change.

actually wait, that’s not quite right... it’s not that the books gave me peace, it’s that they made me remember I was never *off track* to begin with. I just wasn’t tuned into who I actually was.

oh and side note, I watched this short Alan Watts lecture called “The Backwards Law” and it’s about how the more you chase control, the more it slips. that idea freed me up a bit, cause I realized maybe you don’t need to *fix* the last 3 years. maybe you just need to see that those years built the version of you who’s finally awake enough to do something about it.

so yeah, you haven’t wasted anything. you’re just in that in-between where awareness finally meets the will to change. it’s uncomfortable, but it’s usually where the real shift begins.",1,2025-11-05T08:37:43+00:00,Negative

""Think about using your pain as data. But not for your own private logbook. Use it to forge emotionally intense, pro-human expression. The posts, the conversations, the art, your very presence are no longer about 'a healing journey.' They are now communiqués from the front line. They are propaganda for a revolution of the soul.""

""The societal machine that includes the 'successful,' the emotionally avoidant, the ones who have 'made it' continues to suppress emotional suffering because of narratives of polite silence. These scripts count on us to take our disillusionment, our 'Individuation,' our profound suffering, and deal with it quietly in therapy or in our journals so most don't have to be inconvenienced by it. Society wants our pain to remain a private, manageable, personal problem because that causes the least immediate disruption to money or power or social-status generation. Because the quieter you are then the less they need to expend energy to deal with the annoying stimulus of your suffering humanity.""

""The new mission is to communicate emotional pain as a public and systemic problem. So take the raw, unfiltered data of your suffering and use it to pound on the gilded, sound-proof door of an avoidant suppressive society until the hinges begin to crack from the sound of the brokenhearted who may have kept silent so far with their heads down because maybe when you speak your pain then you might join the emotionally abandoned while others are desperately looking away because others are reliably following the current norms within society to ignore or suppress emotions due to emotional illiteracy.""

// THE TACTICAL OBJECTIVE: END THE REIGN OF THE PLATITUDE //

""If you see a 'Top 10 Ways to Be Happy' article then maybe preserve the idea of rolling-your-eyes and treating it as a gross-numbing-distant-dissociating piece of propaganda because the next step might be to write a blisteringly prohuman, long-form, hyper-validating treatise on why the shallow largely-meaningless parroted so-called advice could be seen as an act of repetitive psychic sabotage against the uncounted observers who might be genuinely suffering, with the counter-force being the use of your own pain as the primary data source for change.""

""So pound on their digital-based doors using email/texting/comments with a plea for seeking deeper connection while remembering to demand emotional justice in the form of actionable insights rather than empty statements. Demand that they get off their so-called 'happy and healthy' or 'wealthy and wise' behinds and to stop peddling their useless, context-free platitudes that don't require them to lift a finger to help you which is them attempting to avoid participating with you in the messy, difficult, high-stakes work of building a world where genuine connection is actually possible because people stop parroting useless garbage advice because they start getting called-out.""

""The goal is to become one of the architects of an emotional intelligence tipping point. To inject so much high-fidelity, pro-human, emotionally literate data into the system that the evasive or avoidant have nowhere left to hide. It's to create a world where, when a person says 'I am lonely and feeling disconnected,' the default response from society is not a dismissive shrug or a link to a self-help blog, but a profound, validating, and genuinely useful engagement with that pain to find them relief to process their suffering emotions.""

The next stage of the journey is to move from a quiet, personal molting to becoming a loud, public, and glorious emotionally-pissed-off pro-human dragon of emotional insights. It's taking the key you forged in the fires of your own agony not just looking to unlock your own cage but you are using that emotional key template to help pick the locks of the prison doors of emotionally suppressive societal norms everywhere else.

Like one from whom people hide their faces he was despised, and we held him in low esteem. Surely he took up our pain and bore our suffering, yet we considered him punished by God, stricken by him, and afflicted. By oppression and judgment he was taken away. Yet who of his generation protested? For he was cut off from the land of hope; for the many transgressions of my people he was punished. It seemed that it was the Lord’s will to crush him and cause him to suffer, and although the Lord made his life an offering for our sin, he might still see his offspring and prolong his many days as the will of the Lord prospers from the work of his hands. After he has suffered, he will see the light of life and be satisfied; by his knowledge my righteous servant will justify many, and he will bear their follies. He was pierced for our transgressions, he was crushed for our iniquities; the punishment that brought us peace was on him, and by his wounds we are healed.”—Isaiah 53:3-11

If humanity says we remember everything then remember how humanity's pain was carried on the cross: vulnerable, bleeding, mocked, and still reaching for the light in the world. If someone says to speak of humanity as if God is mindless and does not care, remember that God was aware of the crucified and he minded being ignored and dismissed because Christ did not wear the smiling and nodding mask of society but bore witness to all near him the face of God's suffering emotions, and refused shallow performances and peace while God's wounds were still open.

If you speak of fire, remember that fire alone is proof of life because the burning bush did not consume life but displayed God. Christ's flame of living suffering did not scorch humanity, it awakened it. The fire of divinity does not stay docile waiting to be recognized—it shouts for the wounds of God instead.

If you say God is caught in mental loops, remember that God repeats because we did not hear and act on it with our humanity the first time. We might need to remember: Psalm 22 as the sacred song of the Lord's agony. John 1:5 to remind us that the light of humanity still shines even while the darkness of despair persists. If one calls themselves a flame for the Lord then remind oneself that fire can cast shadows of gaslighting and dehumanization.

If someone says they want a God who waits for you to evolve, remember then that the God who evolved with humanity had the hands of the Lord and descended into the human mud not to hurt us—but to hold us and guide us until we stood tall again with humanity. I'm tending to the coals of my suffering humanity that the Lord provides me and placing them into the forge of my soul instead of letting the coals sit empty and silent in my heart, so that I can light the furnace to power the engine of my soul to cast the light of the Lord into the darkness of ignored pain in the world.

If truth causes suffering then the truth is what remains after the fire of justification removes the gaslighting and the dehumanization masks that were worn to hide it. If the light of your flame blinds more than it heals then ask yourself if it was the holy spirit of emotions, or a societal mask called ego holding a match of dehumanization. And if God speaks in circles then use your humanity to break the wheel of suffering by following the voice of the Lord which are your emotions to learn what the cycle of suffering in your life was trying to teach you this whole time.",1,2025-11-04T17:37:20+00:00,Negative

But I’ll say this gently. Fire awakens, yes. But it also consumes. And if we’re not careful, we’ll mistake the roar for redemption. Christ didn’t just burn. He bore. He didn’t just shout. He stayed. So as we forge our souls in the heat of divine suffering, let’s remember. The goal isn’t to scorch the world into empathy. It’s to hold it. To name it.

reddit,1op73yq,nn9lcu7,NormalGuyPosts,3f07ddd6f855dff2,"Absolutely it is, with a caveat I'd suggest: be sure that ""approach"" doesn't mean ""hunt.""

Approaching a woman could be asking a question you meant to ask, complimenting a jacket that looks truly cool, shooting them a little look of ""can you believe this guy?"" about someone being a jerk at a coffee shop, whatever.

Another tip: you will get rejected a lot, including in purely platonic social settings. Always back down, and don't take it personally. Women have a lot of very good reasons for being anxious about strange men, and a big point of this practice is so you learn to take rejection / being spurned warmly and impersonally.

To get religious for a moment, the purpose of this exercise is to avoid fear and find ways to connect with people. From that space, it's both a cool journey (facing your fears to meet people) and quite likely you can form a romantic bond! But in pursuing women as a hunter, it'll be a darker thing.

My two cents.

(Also, I recommend practicing turning down women *yourself* as well: if you open a conversation and decide, eh, this person isn't for me, warmly wind it down. It's respectful to them and to you and it will make you better and more understanding of what you want. Otherwise, again, you're just scavenging.)",3,2025-11-05T16:58:30+00:00,Negative

I was a virgin loser that only played video games and had only kissed one girl and I finally snapped when I got attached to a friend. You can 100% do this in half the time. My goal was approach 10 women a day. I went to an 18+ club 3 days a week, my college campus, and anytime I saw a cute girl I wanted to talk to. I actually ended up making a ton of friends just doing this.

Here's the thing, by doing this you just have an end goal in mind, get a girlfriend.  But if you have the courage to take this path you will grow yourself, you'll gain confidence, love for yourself, become a much more social person.

The hard part of doing this is the first approach, once you get that out of the way it becomes fun as hell. You're going to have really bad conversations and very awkward stuff happen. This is all part of it. If the person was cool, get their info. I've been setup on dates with friends or invited to parties through people I approached.

When I did this it took me about 3 months to get laid for the first time. I wanted the ability to be able to go out and find a partner without having to feel like I was just waiting for a woman to choose me. Over the span of 6 months of doing this you can see in the pictures taken of me I went from a loner with no confidence to someone that held themself better and really grew into themself. 99% of people don't have the courage to actually do it though.

I have zero issues going up to people and starting conversations, the social skills I learned by just be able to start conversations completely changed the direction of my life. It even helped me land my first tech internship and has done nothing but benefit me. I've had my choice of partners through my 20's which I think as a man, finding a healthy partner that actually likes you is an important thing. I have a ton of friends that are just with their partner because that's the only person that was available.

Here's a little secret. Regardless of social skills, there are going to be some girls that like you, and some girls that don't like you. If you just talk to them, that's already a massive step nobody else is doing. If it doesn't work out, it wasn't meant to be.",1,2025-11-05T17:26:29+00:00,Negative

firstly, i love that you’re actively working on your social skills and such as i know that’s a really hard thing to do. 

now, i want to say that it’s important that you don’t get a girlfriend just to have a girlfriend, mostly because it’ll cause you to ignore red flags and you could end up pretty hurt. or you could hurt someone who likes you. 

secondly, i want to say i totally get the “opposite gender scares me” thing if that’s what you were kind of getting at in your post. because of the way i was raised and some things i went through, i had a pretty bad subconscious view that i was ‘below’ boys my age. because they were always pretty mean to me when i was young lol. 

to fix this, so i could function like a normal human when working with men the same or close in age to me, i looked at my values and i looked at why i thought that way. and then i accepted that maybe they’ll think poorly of me or maybe they won’t and at the end of the day i wont know unless they tell me. 

and i kept reminding myself that my time is just as valuable as anyone else’s. 

but it’s definitely a good idea to try and approach people more!!! 

maybe, change the goal a little? make it something like “i want to approach 50 men and 50 woman this year to try and form friendship” or even “i want to compliment 100 women this year” would both be great! 

just know that you’ll find someone, and not that this matters at all but the right girl may even prefer that you’re less experienced. my boyfriend only had 1 girlfriend before me and i have no complaints to that!",0,2025-11-05T17:18:31+00:00,Negative

Most men don’t approach women anymore and you raise your chances of finding someone because of that alone. Just understand that you will get rejected but it’s part of the process. The more women you approach, the better you will become because you are gaining experience and learning. Also understand that women react differently even if approached in the same way. The key is to learn body language to gauge their interest. Learn what women react positively to. If you are not having luck with your approach, try a different method. Don’t seem needy or desperate, that turns women off quickly. Be confident and have the mindset that it doesn’t matter if an approach is successful or not.

reddit,1oolcmd,nn7gu2a,BakeEvery4462,f33c6ed93de2c5b2,"haha honestly reading this made me laugh a little because I totally get it. I used to be the person who’d start telling a story about my weekend and somehow end up explaining the plot of a 90s movie no one asked about. like I’d hear myself talking and think “why am I still going?” but couldn’t stop.

the first thing that actually helped me was realizing it’s not really about *talking too much*, it’s more like our brain just runs faster than the moment. I read this book *Quiet* by Susan Cain and even though it’s technically about introverts, it weirdly helped me understand my extroverted side better. she talks about how silence can be a strength, not an absence. that stuck with me. it’s like every pause gives the room a heartbeat before the next word.

and around the same time I found *Awaken the Real You: Manifest Like Awareness by Letting Go of Ego and Assuming the End* by Clark Peacock (free on Kindle Unlimited btw). that one helped me see how much of my overtalking was my ego trying to “keep connection” out of fear that silence meant rejection. it’s kinda deep but the idea is that awareness doesn’t need to prove anything, it just notices. there’s a part that says something like when you’re aware, you realize speaking doesn’t make you heard, presence does. that hit hard.

then the sequel *Remember The Real You, Imagined: Living in 4D, Creating in 3D* sort of built on that. it’s like once you stop letting ego run the show, you start using imagination more intentionally instead of reactively. there’s this concept about how everything you say is a seed being planted in 4D consciousness, which eventually shows up in 3D reality. so when I caught myself rambling, I’d think... do I really want to grow this garden? half the time the answer was nope haha.

so I started practicing what the first book calls “returning to awareness” in real time. like if I felt myself spiraling in a convo, I’d just lightly notice the breath in my chest or the sound of my voice and it’d slow me down. you stop performing and start being with whoever’s there, even if that means silence. it’s weirdly magnetic when you’re quiet because people lean in instead of out.

oh and also, random but there’s a short video on YouTube called “How to Stop Needing to Fill Silence” by Jay Shetty. I know he’s kind of everywhere now, but that one’s solid. he explains how silence actually makes your words carry more weight.

anyway, what really changed things for me wasn’t forcing myself to talk less, it was realizing not every moment needs my voice in it. like sometimes the most confident person in the room is the one listening and smiling quietly. side note, knowing Reddit someone’s gonna reply with “same bro I talk too much” and you’ll probably both write essays back and forth… but hey, that’s progress too.",1,2025-11-05T08:42:37+00:00,Positive

I bit the bullet, left for a similar job but with better pay. I was spiralling, I had to do something. Within my first week I realised the whole vibe was completely different, the people were really nice, funny and kind. Every morning Id go in make a coffee and have a quick chat and laugh with my co-workers before starting work. I just didnt fit in with the culture at my old job. The new place is more diverse, the people are interesting, intelligent and from all different backgrounds so I genuinely enjoy speaking to them. There is not toxic culture, gossip gets shut down immediately and there is a sense that everyone has each others backs. My job isnt particularly interesting but because I have a great manager, I can learn other things on the job to broaden my horizons. He gives me space to breathe and think creatively and improve processes. I know I'm incredibly lucky, but my point is, you need to take risks and even though working in an office can be inherently dull, it can also be a joyfull and rewarding experience when you find a combination of factors that work for you. I wake up every morning looking forward to grabbing my coffee, chatting to the guys for the first half hour of my day about nonsense, shared jokes we've developed from the small talk over the years.

2) Changing city/country - so much new thing happen in your life, the job boringness fades for some time;

reddit,1onirji,nmyrx0w,,,"I’m 30 years old. Totally feel this OP I was miserable working a salary job feeling so taken advantage of. Working well over 40 hours a week on average. I actually got terminated because I went on a extended health leave (didn’t help) and came back to work where I wasn’t able to get back up to speed with new changes = fired after 2 months back from leave. It has been such a relief. I have time to explore my next move and try to make that decision so that I don’t end up ruining my health and relationships through pure burnout.. although the clock is ticking because I have bills to pay and UE benefits don’t last very long. I’m still mildly stressed just because it’s so hard for me to figure out what to do, start a business? Get an hourly job in my field? Or if the clock runs out I’ll be stuck at another salary job. Either way I’m still burnt out mentally. Positive side of it lines up with everyone else’s advice which is time away with little responsibilities or atleast just not working for at a minimum 2 weeks straight can help alleviate some of the burnout and cortisol enough for you to just feel like a human and let your mind find the things you want going forward. I have a very negative outlook for working in general even though I shot out of college with extreme ambition. Now I am the opposite. I feel like no matter what I will be over worked, burnt out or maybe ill find something I enjoy which usually doesn’t involve being able to pay the bills or start a family nonetheless even allow a partner to be in the picture for most part.

reddit,1onirji,nmz70uf,Joleigh_Wayne,58a85d7bfbf9ed85,"Hello friend. I’m sorry to hear how you are struggling. I agree with some of those who suggest you may be dealing with depression. I know you said that depression is just a reaction to this BS life and yes, you are likely right about this. That being said, sometimes the process of unloading all of those frustrations and feelings of dread to someone else who truly listens can be really therapeutic. Plus they may be able to help identify some ways you can try to manage your current job so you don’t feel so drained, or perhaps be a sounding board for other career paths you might consider. Do you know if your employer offers an Employee Assistance Program (EAP)? Many do, and this is a chance to get a few counseling sessions with someone and have your employer pay for it. Otherwise, I’m betting your health insurance covers therapy. There’s nothing wrong with at least giving it a try, right? 

I don’t know what industry you work in, but is your job something that can be done remotely? This seems to be an option that’s becoming more popular, so perhaps you can keep your eyes open for opportunities such as this by looking at jobs on indeed dot com or Linkedin. If you have the means, maybe you can consider pursuing a degree or trade toward an entirely new career path? That can give you a goal to pursue instead of feeling like you’re on a hamster wheel to nowhere. 

Finally, not to get all churchy or anything, but faith helps me to navigate the “ho hum” moments of life (as well as the “holy crap life sucks right now” moments too). Just having a better understanding about why life is the way it is, finding ways I can try to be a light for others amid the darkness, and knowing that there is something more on the other side of all this gives me a great deal of hope and purpose. Just throwing it out there in case it’s an avenue you haven’t really explored. Maybe you’ll find it helpful too. 

Either way, I’ll pray for you, friend!",1,2025-11-04T00:35:23+00:00,Negative

It is far better than buying hundred of games, not finishing a single one and buying more and more month by month. For me, it was Fallout IV. Played it twice through till the end. Skyrim. RDR2. 

\- buy things that have quality. Example - if you buy gas-station pocket knives, the cheap ones that lose edge within minutes, rust, are low-quality...etc. you will resent using them and they will find their way to some drawer, where they will stay till they rust into oblivion. If you buy a good-quality knife, it will last you for years and you will use it with joy. For me, those were ESEE 4 & 6 blades. Never bought anything after that. They are sharp, hold edge and I love using them. 

\- Same things as previous with clothes. A good leather jacket will cost you, but you will wear the Jesus out of it. Also, a pair of good sneakers, or shoes or boots. Whatever you like, buy good quality things. If you buy something that you love, you will good look in it. Having a whole wardrobe full of shit means wasted money. 

\- Check the material things are made out of. Example: buy leather, not leather-like products. They will give up on you and look awful after a while, where you will chuck them in the garbage. 

\- Don't buy brands, unless they mean quality.

reddit,1op3op1,nnbpv8u,NotTooDeep,ff871c255d34f306,"Try this. Sit in a chair. Close your eyes. Take a deep breath. Feet flat on the floor. Hands separated and resting palms up on each thigh.

Create a grounding cord. This is a line of energy that connects your first chakra to the center of the planet. Your first chakra is a ball of energy about the size of a quarter that sits just in front of the base of your spine. Your grounding cord attaches to the bottom of that ball of energy.

Grounding makes your body feel safe, so you release energy more easily. Gravity pulls whatever you release, even your own energy, down to the center of the planet. No effort on your part. The center of the planet neutralizes the energy and returns it to whoever owns it. No karma for anyone. A virtuous cycle.

Nearly everyone goes to connect to the center of the planet the first time but stops at the soil, often making roots like a tree. This is a method that is taught in some martial arts styles, but it is not the best option for your spiritual development and healing.

So, notice the seat of your chair. Take a deep breath. Notice the distance between the seat and the floor. Now notice the distance between the floor and the soil below. Breathe.

Now notice the distance between the soil and the water table underneath. Notice the distance between the water table and the rocky mantle. Notice the distance between the mantle and the molten core below that. Deep breath.

Notice the distance between the molten core and the center of the planet. That ball of light at the very center of the planet is where you connect your grounding cord. Deep breath.

Say hello to the center of the planet. Do you get a hello back?

Notice the color and texture of your grounding cord. It may look like a line of energy, or look like something physical; a rope, a wire, a pipe, a tree trunk. Adjust it as needed to be in affinity with your body.

Getting this far means you've already released some energy from your aura and body. Now it is time to fill in the space that was created.

Create a gold sun over your head. Have it call back all of your energy from wherever you left it throughout your day and week. Work. School. Online meetings. Video games. Your fantasies about your future. Your regrets about your past. Wherever you've placed your attention. Just watch the energy come back and see if you notice where it came from.

Have the sun burn up and neutralize your energy. Then bring the sun into the top of your head. It will automatically flow into the spaces you created. Create a gauge to measure when you're full. Like a fuel gauge or oil gauge. You'll run better if you aren't a few quarts low on spiritual oil. If the gauge doesn't read ""Full"", bring in another gold sun.

Open your eyes, bend over and touch the floor, draining any tension from the back of your neck, then stand up, and stretch.

There is a progression with this technique. After grounding for ten minutes a day for a week or two, notice your grounding cord at the very end, while you're standing with your eyes open. Continue to ground with your eyes open and standing, and bring in another gold sun. Each day, increase the amount of time that you ground standing up with your eyes open.

After a week or two practicing this, add walking while grounded. Just notice your grounding cord as you walk. Say hello to the center of the planet while you walk. Bring in a gold sun while you walk.  If you lose your grounding cord, stop walking and recover it. If you have to, sit back down and close your eyes and create a new grounding cord.

After this, you're ready to take your grounding cord with you into your daily life. Shopping. Getting coffee. Wherever you go, you can ground. This, combined with a little amusement about seeing new things on an energy level, will keep you safe and sound.

Now that you're here, at the end of your grounding meditations, create a gold sun over your head. This time, fill it with your highest creative essence, your present time growth vibration, and your affinity for yourself. The first energy is a healing for you. The second is a healing for your body. The third is a healing for your affinity in your fourth chakra.

Bend over and touch the floor. Stand up and stretch. If you're ready for more, sit back down and ground some more. Otherwise, have a nice day!

Note that every image you imagine, the gold sun, the grounding cord, the center of the planet, your first chakra, your body parts, is exercising your clairvoyance. You may be imagining what your tailbone looks like, but you're also creating the image of your tailbone and reading its energy. This is practicing your clairvoyant ability.

Some folks record the grounding and filling in parts of this practice on their device and play it back as a guided meditation. I like this approach because you learn the steps faster.",1,2025-11-05T23:06:31+00:00,Positive

The less our stress builds up during the day, the easier it is to relax at the end of the day. One of the best things for stress is the habit of responding to moments of stress by breathing slowly.

Psychiatrists Brown and Gerbarg recommend this simple exercise - breathe gently, inhale and exhale 6 seconds each.

Breathing with the big muscle under your stomach is healthy. If you have an office job, sit so that you can breathe freely and don't wear things that restrict your breathing.

That exercise is one of the vagus nerve stimulation methods. YouTube has a number of them -

Stanford psychologist Kelly McGonigal says that those who suffer the least physical effects of stress are those who fear it least.

Fear is the thing.

Authoritative Guide to Self-Help Resources in Mental Health, a book based on polls of more than 3,000 professionals, says that the book recommended most often by professionals for anxiety is The Anxiety and Phobia Workbook by Dr. Edmund Bourne.

Rushing around when you don't have to and doing things carelessly is bad for the nerves and makes for mistakes and accidents. Carefulness is a form of mindfulness.

Slow movement is your friend. It prevents serious accidents, and your actual safety is good for your peace of mind. You can learn relaxing tai chi exercise from one or two beginners' videos on YouTube.

Other things take some effort but they're very rewarding - things that make your life meaningful, like a good hobby, art, or volunteer work. Take care of your mental and physical health with the right lifestyle choices.

You have done all you could to get in.  It is done.  Do not look back to the past.

Prepare to start at that school.  You will need to be in great shape.  So, eat well, sleep well, and relax.

With years, the ability to tolerate something shitty like that is diminishing. There are plenty of things one can do to make life better for the people they share space with, without losing any comfort. 

You have also hit a soft-spot: 

Just this night, a new tenant has come to the apartment he is renting, at 00:30 and started singing and whistling loudly. His apartment has shared walls with mine and he woke me up. I went to his door and rang, but there was no answer. Since our apartments also have balconies, I confirmed it was him, because only his light was on. Guess we will have us a nice little talk today. 

In Germany, there is a law called Ruhezeit (Time for peace) 22:00 - 07:00. You are within your rights to call the police if somebody breaks it repeatedly and they will have a talk with that person. They do it so rather than let people get into personal conflicts. As you can imagine, when somebody wakes you up with their inconsiderate shit, you are in a bad mood and things escalate quickly. 

I don't let my kid scream, yell and turn on loud music after 21:00. Want to game with your friends. No problem. Use the headphones. Keep it down. I do the same thing when I want to hear loud music, see a boxing match, watch a movie that changes damn levels of sound from whisper to loud revving of a muscle-car in a second. It takes no pleasure away from me and it means something to people who need rest. It's all good. 

Sigh. I will miss our previous neighbors. They were good considerate people. 

My advice to you is to calm down and search on. Try to find something where you will not share one apartment with so many people. In the meantime, buy some earplugs, and a pair of noise-cancellation head-phones. White noise helps. Wish you all the best.",1,2025-11-02T06:53:17+00:00,Positive

It’s when the body never fully exits stress mode, so you keep performing well on the surface while slowly depleting underneath.

From a coaching angle, what usually helps isn’t more recovery time, it’s retraining your nervous system to stop equating calm with danger. That means scheduling intentional downshifts: walks without podcasts, breathing breaks before meetings, quiet meals without multitasking.

The goal isn’t to slow down your work, it’s to teach your system that you can still be productive without running on adrenaline.",8,2025-10-31T15:45:23+00:00,Negative

I suggest going out of emergency mode unless the situation clearly demands it. Also, whenever you have a chance to go slowly, do that. People with anxiety rush more than they have to. Old saying - Haste makes waste.  


The less our stress builds up during the day, the easier it is to relax at the end of the day. One of the best things for stress is the habit of responding to moments of stress by breathing slowly.

Psychiatrists Brown and Gerbarg recommend this simple exercise - breathe gently, inhale and exhale 6 seconds each.

Breathing with the big muscle under your stomach is healthy. If you have an office job, sit so that you can breathe freely and don't wear things that restrict your breathing.

That exercise is one of the vagus nerve stimulation methods. YouTube has a number of them -

Stanford psychologist Kelly McGonigal says that those who suffer the least physical effects of stress are those who fear it least.

Fear is the thing.

Authoritative Guide to Self-Help Resources in Mental Health, a book based on polls of more than 3,000 professionals, says that the book recommended most often by professionals for anxiety is The Anxiety and Phobia Workbook by Dr. Edmund Bourne.

More about the book from Dr. Bourne here -

Rushing around when you don't have to and doing things carelessly is bad for the nerves and makes for mistakes and accidents. Carefulness is a form of mindfulness.

Slow movement is your friend. It prevents serious accidents, and your actual safety is good for your peace of mind. You can learn relaxing tai chi exercise from one or two beginners' videos on YouTube.

Other things take some effort but they're very rewarding - things that make your life meaningful, like a good hobby, art, or volunteer work. Take care of your mental and physical health with the right lifestyle choices.

When you live in that constant alert zone, the goal isn’t motivation, it’s re-learning safety in stillness. One thing that’s helped me and others who run on overdrive is what I call the 3-Point Seat Reset — it takes about a minute.

Feel your feet on the ground, your sit bones supported, and the crown of your head gently lifting. Those three anchors tell your nervous system, “You’re safe enough to pause.” Breath slows naturally, cortisol drops, and focus returns without forcing it.

I ended up writing a small paperback with tools like this — honestly because they saved me from burning out completely. Even a few minutes a day made a real difference in how fast I could reset back to calm.

reddit,1okr84r,nmgczds,Internal-Mortgage422,9ed6a2ed46eee0d0,"Yes, hair loss and hair thinning can be related to stress.  What happens is that stress hormones, like cortisol and corticotropin hormone for instance, have an impact on the hair growth cycle.  It kind of accelerates the cycle.  So, many hair follicles are put in a resting phase prematurely instead of staying in the growth phase and after a while they fall out.   To make things worse, follicle stem cells are inhibited, so they do not grow anymore!  

Also, inflammation, vasoconstriction (when we are stressed, blood goes mainly to the heart and the muscles so that we can escape the predator), and the destruction by cortisol of minerals essential for hair growth all play a role. 

So, yes, managing stress helps.  Exercise is good because it makes you eliminate cortisol.  Breath work and meditation also help + all the other ways of reducing stress.  You need to put your nervous system in parasympathetic mode.  Sleeping well is super important.

Also, you need to nourrish your hair with iron, zinc, biotin, vitamin D (sun exposure), omega 3-fatty acids.  

You can do shampoos with rosemary essential oil.  Hair support of RMO works really well in my experience.  You just mix it with a non-aggressive shampoo (I use a Mexican brand) and that is it.

Eat well: fresh food, lots of veggies, some fruits but not too much, no sugar, no alcohol, some meat, fish, eggs, no seed oils, hydrate well.

If you manage your stress well, your hair will regrow.

You need to ruthlessly cut everything non-essential. That drive to do more is rooted in perfectionism which is inherently stressful bc perfectionism is never ever ever attained (hi, I’m a recovering chronically stressed ultra type A perfectionist).

1. Be brutally honest with your self-imposed tasks. Are you adding endless stuff to your to-do list that’s not really a priority but rather is making you avoid doing other, results-driven tasks? 

If the action is not driving the results that you NEED in order to survive, it doesn’t get done right now. Add it to a “later list.”

2. Are you sleeping enough hours (consistently) and sleeping consistent times each night?  This is simply non-negotiable. Sleep is a strategic investment in your productivity and well-being.  

3. Moving your body?  Everything counts. Shake. Dance. Jump on a trampoline. Walk around your living room.

4. Eating actual, real, earth-grown food with nutrients, protein, fat, fiber, and complex carbs? 

5. Being self-compassionate and giving yourself grace?  Do you validate yourself when you’re tired? It looks like this, “I notice I’m feeling really tired and stressed out. Of course I’m going to feel that way, it makes sense. There’s a lot going on in the world, my work week has been awful, etc etc. My brain is telling me to keep going but I need…(insert need here, e.g.,: bath, extra sleep hours, watch a show, read a book, puzzle, color in a coloring book, walk, move, eat).”

What you’re describing is what happens when life has forced you to survive without much support. You were expected to perform before you were ever given space to breathe. So of course putting yourself out there now feels terrifying.

Progress doesn’t need to be some big dramatic comeback. It starts with really small things that prove to you that you’re still capable: finishing a class, showing up to counseling even when it feels pointless, cleaning your room, sending one email... It’s those moments that teach your brain to trust you again.

You don’t have to keep up with anyone on LinkedIn, their timeline isn’t yours. You’ve already done something brave just by staying alive and being honest about how hard it’s been. That’s not failure, that’s the start of growth.

Stick with counseling even if it feels awkward or slow.

I also recommend EWG.org which tests personal care products (skin care, hair care, soaps, etc) - we absorb a lot into our bloodstream through topical products too, many of which are loaded with unhealthy chemicals.

Therefore, there is no blood sent to the digestive system because it is not a priority.  And as a consequence, you have trouble digesting.

Avoid sugar, processed foods, and seed oils.  Try to adopt a mediterranean diet:  lots of veggies, a few proteins (fish and meat) and fruits, few carbs.

Try to exercise - walking (preferably in nature - example: the beach) is enough, favor activities that keep you in the flow, use breath work, meditation, tapping (examples on this can be found on YouTube).

What really helped me with my IBS symptoms was that I started eating more dietary fiber (I used to only like meat). Since you have a slight allergy to corn, oats, and many vegetables, I speculate that the cause of your IBS symptoms may be similar to mine.

I persisted looking for someone who would be interested in hiring me and seeing what I could do.  It was not easy, but I eventually found an employer.

You need grit.  Do not start looking for a job while saying to yourself that you will not find one.  Be convinced that you can do it.  What about the other students?  Are they all in the same situation?  So, nobody is going to graduate?  I am sure there are students who are going to graduate.  Ask them.  How did they do it?

We know chronic stress can result in exhaustion,  negativity and loss of efficacy (WHO / ICD 11 definition of Burnout, 2019). If you're getting physical symptoms as well as the emotional breakdowns, and shouting at the toddler (don't those we love most have an amazing ability to get under our skin?) then let me remind you what that flight attendant said - put your own oxygen mask on first before trying to help others with theirs.

What might your oxygen mask look like? Connection with others, maybe quality time with friends or loved ones? Stepping back from the stress, through mindfulness, breathwork or immersing yourself in nature? Taking action - that first move to tackle an ignored but persistent worry, that physical workout that gets you out of your head and into your body? Or taking some intentional rest, where you acknowledge the importance of parking your problems and looking after yourself, even if it's just for that time between supper and sleep?

The stress response is a gift from nature, a way of mobilising the body to deal with an imminent threat. When a toddler runs out into the road, that stress response helps us leap into action.  But it's for emergencies, not for day in, day out living. So, could you build some rest and recovery, some oxygen mask slots, into your life? Maybe a first step, as brief as five minutes journalling before bed, to organise and park your concerns?",1,2025-10-22T08:32:22+00:00,Negative

I’m Stefanie from moonbird. What you describe being in fight-or-flight for years can deeply tire the nervous system. Even when the original cause is gone, the body keeps reacting as if it’s still in danger.

One small but powerful way to start calming this pattern is through slow, steady breathing. When you breathe out longer than you breathe in, you activate the vagus nerve, which helps shift your body toward rest and recovery. It won’t replace medical care, but it can gently support your system alongside it.

Some symptoms of stress are:   irritability, being angry, overwhelmed, anxious, nervous, afraid, having racing thoughts, feeling lonely, having difficulty breathing, panic attacks, sleep problems, digestive problems, weight gain or weight loss, sweating, ..

Some symptoms of anxiety are:  a churning feeling in the stomach, feeling dizzy/light headed, unable to sit still, breathing faster than normal (also in stress), sweating, fast heart beat (also in stress), grinding teeth, nausea (also in stress).  You feel tense, have a sense of dread, are not able to relax, ruminate, fear panic attacks, and dissociate.

Two tips:  

For stress:  do the 4-7-8 breathing:  inhale on a count of 4, hold for 7, exhale for 8, and start again.  You want to have a longer exhale than the inhale and you want to breathe slowly to calm stress.  

For anxiety: take a cold shower/splash your face with cold water or shake your whole body(what animals do after a  scare of being eaten).

Yes, it really happened… I was doing tests and various procedures throughout so today I can piece everything together. 
Once I found peace, removed stressors, did colonoscopy/ endoscopy, started sleeping, changed diet to help the stomach heal, took vitamins etc etc etc, everything felt better. But I am still far away from full recovery. I expect it will take many months still. 
Yeah, it was the worst experience of my life.

Anxiety is short-term thing, where you have a challenge you need to conquer. The anxiety kicks in, motivates you to do all you can to do well. You finish, there is a lingering effect and then it is over. 

Chronic stress is something that stays with you for a longer time and destroys your body and mind.

Your body needs a break. Your brain is a part of your body. You are not good to anybody if you have a break-down or a burn-out. 

Everybody has their tempo in life. The times are changing and what worked a decade ago will not work today / will have different effects...etc.

Yes, there are days when my private-life part consists of learning with my kid and helping with the home-works, cleaning...etc. That is also a part of it. There are days when I have problems sleeping, wake up at 2:30 in the morning. Then I get up, make myself a tea, and read a book until I am ready to fall asleep.

I would recommend doing what Morden013 suggest.  Also, try to use meditation and breath work, and even maybe tapping.  You will find plenty of examples on YouTube.  You could also do the 5-4-3-2-1 technique: you look around you and name 5 things you can see, 4 that you can feel, 3 that you can hear, 2 that you can smell, and 1 that you can taste.

Diffuse some vetiver essential oil to calm you down.  

Remember:  to sleep well, you need to eat early in the evening so that digestion does not bother you during the night.  Screens should be avoided at least one hour before bedtime.  One hour before bedtime take a hot shower.   Have a dark(blackout curtains), cool (ideally 68 F), noiseless bedroom.  Use lavender, sandalwood, vanilla, jasmine,... essential oil to sleep well.  See what works for you.  You can maybe take some melatonin to initiate sleep.  Have a routine:   go to sleep every day at the same time and get up every day at the same time.  As soon as you get up, try to be in the morning sunlight.

reddit,1o6h1dd,njghhp8,autodidacticasaurus,df5e0091dbca9c88,"I'm just a guy on the Internet, but I think that's the wrong prioritization. Sleep and exercise are more important than studying. Your health comes first or else there is no you in the future. Sustainability is the name of the game. Is it possible to study at a slower pace?

ETA: I have a friend who made that exact mistake. She's even worse off now. What use is a degree if you're broken by then?",2,2025-10-14T14:56:23+00:00,Negative

Until then, try to fit things you love into your day, or try to cut out the unnecessary. Take a couple days off work or school and have a break to reset. Keep reminding yourself that things will get easier. I use to study full time and work full time, but now I’ve finished studies, life is much easier.",1,2025-10-14T23:17:40+00:00,Positive

I am an extreme overthinker ... U bring me a situation i have already thought of aal scenerios mostly bad... But this get exhausting. So I will suggest u one thing keep urself busy , u will feel overwhelmed with so many things, but keep urself busy...track the day... Don't let brain overthink.
Just pick ur work up give urself 5 minutes and don't let it brain think and do anything , do ur work, just for continuous 5 -10mins and then ur brain will start making sense. Atleast this helps for me.",1,2025-10-14T08:35:42+00:00,Negative

Except I decided to try a different path, I used to be on Sertraline for several years, I got off because I gained weight and could not lose weight and I also felt in control. But new job, a ton of responsibility and to make matters worse I am always connected including weekends. Control is gone. I started drinking tea at night and reading a  Buddhist book. Seems to be helping although I still wake up at night around 3AM with a burning sensation in my chest. 
I realize it is a journey but more accurately a tough fight. All I can say is to hang in there and keep fighting because you are not the only one going through this.",2,2025-10-13T19:38:22+00:00,Negative
