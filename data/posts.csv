reddit,mentalhealth,1oq2poc,Backpack1995,0c485ad20f8e8eb8,"I used to be the gifted kid. Now I feel like a lazy, empty shell","i feel so much shame writing this. I’m 28. Everyone in my family, all my old friends, they all think I'm this super successful person. I have a good job in marketing. I have the apartment. I have the degree but i feel like i'm 80 years old.

I was the gifted kid all through school. Straight A's. AP classes. Honors society. Valedictorian. Full ride to a good university. Graduated magma cum laude. It was my whole identity. I just... achieved things. That's what I did. I got this job right out of college. It was fine. I got promoted. It was fine.

Now... I don't know when it happened. Maybe two years ago? A year ago? It feels like a switch flipped. I can't do it anymore.

I log on at 9. I stare at my email. I open a document. I read the same sentence 10 times. I go make coffee. I scroll on my phone for 45 minutes. I go to the bathroom. I'm doing the absolute bare minimum to not get fired. My boss, who used to praise me, now has that concerned tone in our 1:1s. I just nod and say ""yep, working on it"" knowing full well I haven't done anything. I'm drowning in tasks I used to be able to do in an hour.

I am so, so tired. I feel nothing. But I also feel this crushing, screaming anxiety all the time.

I keep thinking I'm just lazy. My parents worked so hard. I have all this privilege and opportunity and I'm just... wasting it. I'm not depressed, am I? I don't feel sad. I just feel... gone. Weekends are the same. I have no energy to see friends. I just lie on my couch and order food and watch TV i'm not paying attention to. I don't know what this is. I just know the person i used to be is gone.

reddit,mentalhealth,1oqpgva,laydeelou,a5d14f6d326d59ea,My boyfriend cries,"My (35f) partner (40m) has had his dealings with depression over the years, history of family trauma.

Last night he was singing in the bath and when he came down I said ‘I enjoyed your singing’ And he said ‘it stops me from crying’

I thought it was a joke… then he tells me he’s been crying every day, whenever he’s alone, he can’t stop it he just cries.

And I’m scared. I’ve only known him to cry and couple of times, I had no idea it was every day atm. He’s been extremely low recently since we had a new baby a few months ago, he’s having therapy, he’s on medication.

I asked if I could do anything, he said no. He knows I love him, he knows I’m here for him. (But I’m also parenting two young children almost independently at the moment) I’ve been pushy recently because he’s signed off sick from work because he had a cold… he’s stopped leaving the house, eating badly, doom scrolling etc.

I asked him to come off social media (he has except tiktok which is the worst IMO)

I’ve asked him to come out on walks with me, he often declines, I’ve asked him to go to the gym (he was going daily) he refuses.

We have a baby and a toddler; she doesn’t want to go near him atm, refusing cuddles, even said ‘I don’t like you’ the other day. This is crushing him further but she’s two! I know she adores him but she does this, and he’s taking it personally.

I’m so scared he’s going to do something one day and I don’t ever want to lose him

I don’t know how to keep him safe

He hasn’t said he will. But I know that 99% of the time if you’re gonna do it, you’re not going to tell anyone ",8,4,2025-11-07T08:58:45+00:00,https://reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/1oqpgva/my_boyfriend_cries/,Negative

I've had a pretty tough childhood, and my house had really bad, dirty bathrooms and moldy showers that I did my best to avoid.

Now, I totally understand this isn't okay. I know I need to shower every day, but it's just so hard for some reason. I feel so anxious about it and I have no idea why. Just thinking about showing makes me stressed. Maybe it's a little bit depression? It does feel like a lot of work sometimes because I'm just so uncomfortable in the shower. I don't really know. I just am worried I smell bad(even though I use a lot of deodorant, but I know that's not enough) and I'm worried my roommates think I'm gross. I really don't want to be gross.

Just now, my mom kicked me out of the house. She splashed water on me, called me worthless, and said if she had known I’d grow up like this, she would have had an abortion. She made me pack all my things and leave with my bike.

For context, she was really angry because I didn’t go to help at our store today. She called me at 8 AM, but I was still at home around 3 PM, I was dealing with nervousness and anxiety at this time and I wanted to explain to her but She cursed at me, said I’m a disappointment, and brought up how I still haven’t graduated after two years, while my cousins already have I'm 16,im still at grade 10 but I should be first year senior high right now... 

Right now, I’m sitting at a park not too far from home. I feel completely lost and broken, and honestly, part of me feels like ending it all. But I’m trying to stay mindful before I make any choice. I’m posting this to reach out to anyone who’s been through something similar — I really just need someone to listen and maybe help me figure out what to do next.

I’m 19, and I’ve been reflecting on my life lately.  I’ve always struggled socially.  When I was in the third grade I was placed in a special education class.  My classmates treated me differently after that.  My classmates, who were the same age as me, would be surprised to hear that I knew how to read or do anything.  It wasn’t that bad, nobody tormented me.  But I could tell that I was below everyone else, nobody took me seriously besides my group of friends.  This was my school experience until high school when I switched schools.  I still reflect on it more than I probably should.  Something I’ve been thinking about lately is how I would self depreciate when I was younger.  I cringe at some of the things I remember saying.  I’ve always had a weird relationship with self esteem and confidence and all that.  Should I tell myself that I self depreciated because of my low self esteem?  Or is it possible that I was seeking attention in a scummy way?  I fear that the latter might be true.  I really hate thinking about myself as some attention seeking victim card player, I hope that’s not who I was.  Anyhow, it’s probably strange that I deeply think about my childhood this much.

reddit,mentalhealth,1oqpw8c,Possible-Article7796,4d91e574f6ad9d56,Got no tears left to cry,"So, let me set the context in brief. 

I am in my mid 20s working full time. All throughout my life, I have been very frustrated. I was very insecure due to body dysmorphia all throughout my teenage years up until my early 20s. I was mocked at and belittled by my peers on several occasions, but I just couldn't do anything about it. Due to this, I had a very low self esteem and massive inferiority complex (still kinda have it). I felt I will NEVER be accepted for the way I am. All of this led me to spend all these years in my head, contemplating and over analyzing everything. I had been a victim to bullying in my early childhood and body shaming as well. This led me to enclose myself in a cocoon and never let anyone in nor go out of that shell. Academically, I was good. But, all these negative thoughts have always acted as a bottleneck to my peak performance. It impacted my focus and executive function, which I think led me to not being able to achieve what I feel I could easily have, if I had the right support. I've always wanted to fall in love and have relationships (and the fun that constitutes it) like the other people I saw around. But, I always had the fear that I would be considered weak because I was never in the right state of mind to have a normal conversation with anyone, let alone approach a girl. I wasn't completely alone though. I did have friends, but as I said, I could never connect with them deeply. All of it seemed superficial. I had strict parents too. They had their own mental health issues. They put a lot of restrictions on me and used to mentally torture me, to the extent which nornal Indian parents don't do. But, they loved me a lot, they still do.

Now, cutting to the chase, I feel there's no hope anymore. I feel people of my age have had many more experiences than me. The joy of hanging out together, chit chatting. The joy of being in a romantic relationship with one who has previously never been in any. The process of growing up together emotionally. I've missed out on all that. I feel I may not even get married. All of this is driving me insane. I took SSRIs for 5 months, they numbed down the symptoms but led to weight gain. And just like my loyal unwanted guests, the symptoms arrived back again. I always feel that other men of my age are at a much better position than me. And why it kills me from inside is the fact that I know I am much better than many others in so many aspects. My managers at work have pointed that out too. Still, I suffer in life and the rest enjoy. I feel there's no cure to this. I can't focus on anything. My executive function has gone for a toss. I am finding it very hard to deal with this heaviness everyday. Life feels like moving through molasses.

Need your kind advice and suggestions!

Some days it feels heavy, confusing, or just empty. But I hope we never get tired of pursuing the life we always wanted, the peace, the meaning, the quiet kind of happiness that feels like home.

Even if progress feels slow, even if healing takes longer than we hoped, it’s still happening quietly, gently, in ways we don’t always notice.

I was ringing out a customer and I had thought the transaction went through but found out later that it didn't. Before I found out, I was trying to get the cap off of the alcohol the guy was looking to purchase but couldn't get it off so I told him he could just grab a different one and I'd redo the transaction. When I re-printed out the receipt, I noticed the item was completely different than the one he was looking to purchase so I refunded that order. And then the guy said the transaction went through on his banking app, he was lying. So I not only refunded a previously made order but the guy walked out without paying for his alcohol. Obviously I had to write down what happened and the paper is on the desk in the office. Thus I'm waiting my boss' inevitable call in the morning. While this is the first time this kind of incident has occurred, I have made other mistakes similar to this and since it's alcohol this time, it can get serious. The call either be my boss pointing out my mistake in detail or a notice of termination. While I may not like this job very much and do wish to get out of it, I unfortunately can't yet.

I was never close to my Dad, and never had an actual mentor who taught me how to navigate life as a man, and how to lead a family. 

He would take me fishing and he would get angry every time I reeled in my line and the bait was missing. I would feel the line being tugged, and I assumed I had caught a fish. He would stare me down and speak through clinched teeth that I was wasting bait. There was no actual teaching or encouragement involved. 

I want to be fair with my own assessment, and the fishing trips are part of many experiences I've had like this. Is this emotional neglect?

I have a job that i love. A family, friends, and a beautiful girlfriend that all love and support me. I have hobbies and interests and future plans, and so much I want to do and see.  

But I constantly get this feeling like something is missing. When I’m alone in my room and my girlfriend is asleep and I can’t fall asleep just yet, I get this overwhelming sense of anxiety and dread. Like all the good parts of my life have passed and I’ll never get them back, and that there’s nothing new for me. 

Obviously I know that factually it’s not true. I have a lot to look forward to in life, and It’s not like I have a bad life either. I’d say its pretty good! So It really makes no sense to me why this happens. 
I’m very aware depression doesnt just affect people who have bad lives, but I dont always feel this way. It’s only when I’m alone at night. But it’s so overwhelming and I get the sense that I have to do something to fix it,
 but everything I try distracting myself with just makes me bored and amplifies that ‘nothing matters or has purpose’ feeling tenfold. 

Does anyone else feel similarly? And is there anything you can reccomend that might help / has helped you with this?

It started creeping up during my last year of college when I started commuting and living at home but ever since I started my job (which is completely remote) I have just been so unmotivated and depressed. I hate my job, I feel like I'm contributing nothing meaningful to this world but I know it's not smart to quit for financial reasons so I'm hanging in until I decide what I want to do with my life. There's nothing particularly stressful about my job either so it's just my lack of interest in the field which is completely on me.

I've been looking to go back to school for something in healthcare but it's just so expensive. Living at home just makes me feel like I'm in high school again during covid. I could move out but it would just be dumb to waste money on rent. I'm just at crossroads of what I want to do with my life, I'm trying to find some kind of direction that is realistic but can also provide me fufillment.

reddit,mentalhealth,1oqp1w4,ImNotPretty111111,4003aef6333e7a51,I dont even know how to put what I think into words,"I have too much im thinking about right now to even put them in the right order or right words. I want to start by saying that I was a very special kid with a bright future. I was pretty, so smart, and I was always so positive and always so happy. I lived in another country and I was still positive and happy until I was 9 and moved to a different country with my family. I was still kind of positive and happy even after coming here but when I was around 10 I faced a lot of bullying.



 It's funny because I am not the typical person who gets bullied. I honestly thought I was a pretty girl, and I was overly confident. It humbled me and scarred me when I was 10. It made me think ive always been ugly, just delusional about being pretty. Boys used to always come onto me and tried their best to convince me "" I was ugly and poor"". It's funny because Im sorry for saying this but there were definitely worse looking girls in my grade. So this really hurt my pride as a girl who thought I was pretty at that time. 

  
Anyways, now Ive let that and some other things affect my entire life. I was pretty as a child so why do I feel so ugly now? Ive heard it from people too, but I dont understand. I have brown hair, blue eyes, pink lips, I have a good body shape  and a lot of good qualities but ive always been so ignored and looked over. But at least I still had some hope that everything would work out for me, that my life  would be brighter and I would gain the beauty from my childhood back.

At only 13 I became obsessed with biomechanics and beauty, I found out that tongue posture, breathing habits, posture, the way you eat, the way you talk, the way you sleep, the way you do basically anything effects your face. I started being obsessed with every little thing and I basically can say I had a cycle of crying about how I look, next day feeling very pretty, next day trying too hard and crying again about being the ugliest person in the world. In short, I can say my feelings are sooo bipolar. I always fall into months of depression after 1 month of being hopeful and happy. 

  
I also have trust issues over other girls and feel like they're always competing with me. Since the way I grew up, how my friends used to pretend they're more superior to me, I got trust issues with any friend I have. I always think they're trying so hard to feel superior to me, and even when they make me feel even a little unworthy I leave. I am so tired of feeling like every other girl "" is happy because they are prettier than me"". Literally a lot of people has told me im pretty too. Im so confused. Im just sabotaging myself. Everyday when im at school I have harsh headaches thinking about how I look, how I act etc. And hating everyone and not wanting to do anything for everyone.

>My thoughts are racing 24/7 its as if Ive lost my ability to think normally, I change my opinion and think so messy that I dont even know what Im thinking at the moment. It's just a constant non ending stress. Now ive also stopped trying, I just go to school and come home, dont even try at school. I feel so guilty for it because I also have parents who did everything for me and im their only child so I also feel a constant GUILT for everything im experiencing. It's as if im addicted to stress. Even though im not addicted at my phone I look at my phone as if it's my duty to ruin that day. Im only 17 and a half and im so sad that ive wasted that child I was like this.

I had a mixed experience on the K. From session 4 being a near feeling cure to session 5 being the worst panic attack. I finished the 12 sessions, and gained a lot, but #5 ruined the 5 days I felt cured from #4. 

My therapist is certified and can administer MDMA legally. I’m nervous because I’ve never done it. 

I take 60mg of Adderall (legally prescribed) and Lunesta for sleep. 

I’m just hoping there is someone out there who’s done MDMA for depression and CPTSD, and can give me their perspective. 

My anesthesiologist told me I require more medication due to how quickly I metabolize it. He was the MD at my Ketamine facility. The logic checks out as I always have to take more than is normal for surgery or after care. 

Anyone out there who can explain how the clinic MDMA experience is, considering I’ve done heavy IV clinical Ketamine.

reddit,mentalhealth,1oqk8kk,xnotxlayla,37fc757a84c063f0,Been playing FiveM since I was 15 and Im 19 and I cant seem to stop,"Hey everyone ,

Ive been playing **FiveM** since I was about 15 , and now 19 , Ive realized its become a huge part of my life... For anyone who doesnt know , *FiveM* is basically a multiplayer modification of **GTA V** that lets people create or join custom servers and you can add ur own mods like custom cars , clothes , maps , and even roleplay as different characters... Its super creative and social , which is what hooked me in the first place...

Over the years , I ended up creating my **own FiveM community** , and now it has **over 30,000 members**. Its crazy to think about , and I’m honestly proud of what Ive built... But at the same time , its become really hard for me to step away from it... I feel like I cant stop playing or managing it and like if I took a break , Id be letting everyone down... I dont want to shut it down because I know it would upset a lot of people , but I also know deep down that I should be caring about myself first . I dont want to give it away to someone else either , cause it feels like such a personal thing that I built from the ground up...

There have been **rumors going around that FiveM might be shutting down** , and as much as I dont want to believe it , part of me thinks it might be true... The thought of that actually made me realize how much of my identity is tied to this game... I know I dont want to be doing this forever and if it really does shut down , Ill have to move on eventually but even then , I dont know when that will happen...

I guess I just wanted to get this off my chest... Its weird being so attached to something digital , but its been my routine , my comfort zone , and my social life for years now... Has anyone else ever felt like this ? Like u built something u love , but its also the thing keeping u stuck ?",2,1,2025-11-07T03:50:52+00:00,https://reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/1oqk8kk/been_playing_fivem_since_i_was_15_and_im_19_and_i/,Positive
reddit,mentalhealth,1oqo5je,glutinousrabbit,a0d80b130d535bbe,"Seriously, why is it like this?","Recently, I asked my mom what I had to look forward to when I get older. She told me “Honestly not much, you ache a lot and work until you die. I worry about your and your brother’s future because of how things are going- at least I’ll probably die before the world goes totally to shit.”

What am I even meant to do with that. I don’t know anyone older than me (I’m in my 20s) who is happy or even content. I come from a lower class blue collar family and it seems that unless I get stupidly rich by some miracle, I am damned to the fate that most people in this world are.

Maybe it’s my youthful ignorance or something, I don’t know. I’ve been in the work force for almost a decade and I’m already hating this shit. I cannot comprehend why we spend the prime of our lives - where we are most virile and mentally alert- working like dogs, then we (if lucky) retire. By the point we retire, our mental faculties are on the decline and our bodies are failing. I want to go travel the world, I have no money or time now or realistically within a very long time to travel the world, and by the time I have the money AND time I am going to be old. 

Everyone I ask says “the point is to find the small good things in between all the bad”.. but does there have to be SO much bad?  Why can’t life be the good thing? “nobody likes it but that’s just the way it is” ?? If we all hate it then can’t we change it??


I’m losing my mind. There has to be some other way. There has to be a point to this. I don’t want to spend my whole life suffering just to end up decaying in a nursing home in front of a Jeopardy re-run and playing slots on my phone.

reddit,mentalhealth,1oqhaef,yeahthislldo,59ab68f4c32446cd,Wrongly jealous of my military dad,"
The title is probably a wrong way of putting it but….. 

My dad was a serving soldier in the British Army from 1992 to 2017. And I joined up in 2021 leaving in 2025 doing the legal minimum. He has severe PTSD, with a large amount of associated mental illnesses with the military.

My main point of this is that I’m jealous that he got to go to go to war, he was basically at war from 1995 to 2013 which obviously associated with his mental illnesses. And he has real stories to tell me and my children, whereas myself can only tell of a few humanitarian missions that I was on. My time in the army was filled with mostly email and appeasing ever demanding higher ups. And I know it’s wrong to be jealous of his experiences because of what he’s going through now, but I can’t feel like I missed out something or I’m not a proper soldier as I never went through the same experience as he did. I feel as if my service is invalidated by his, or what I did is reduced by what he managed to do by he was my age. That all I ever did was collect a wage and waste five years of my life. And with an ever increasing military presence on the internet I just feel I have to fit this stereotype of ‘veteran’ that did something or sacrificed something. And it’s terrible because I gave the first 5 years of my adulthood to this army and have gained nothing from it, but also I have no story to tell.

If people want to tell me I’m chatting shit please do, it’s just a comparative internet lifestyle is eating away at  me.",3,2,2025-11-07T01:29:31+00:00,https://reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/1oqhaef/wrongly_jealous_of_my_military_dad/,Negative

I filled my schedule up to help cope and didn’t set aside time for my long distance girlfriend… I fucked up she broke up with me today saying I dismissed her interests, were always putting everything before her, too tired to talk, she said “if I say I love you say I love you too , do not say love you too.” Without realizing or caring at the time I was causing our relationship to collapse… Actually pretty sure I did and I didn’t care and that’s scaring me. When she would come back into town for the weekend I would say I’m busy at work… I really just didn’t feel like leaving my house I didn’t want her to fully know how fucked up I was mentally since I thought that would push her away. I have no one to talk to this about since I stopped seeing my therapist a month ago since he was longer helping. 

I feel like I’m at a breaking point and don’t have anything to really contribute to anymore… every friendship I make I feel like I cause more pain than good… even my family I don’t feel like I do any good for. I gave up on cleaning my spaces and my mom has been constantly mad at me, I feel like my brother hates me, my dad is dying from Huntington disease and I’ve been slowly watching him progress and get worse and worse. My grandparents that are still alive are on the other side of the country and they are struggling with health issues. My aunt and uncle hate me they just won’t tell me they have shown so many signs. My old online friend group went their own ways and we don’t really talk now days.

Simply put looking over this I’m clearly past my breaking point and idk what to do I feel like just ending it but I’m too much of a bitch to do anything so I’m just sitting here suffering… I’m supposed to go to a convention all weekend but I don’t feel like I can should since I feel I will just disappoint my friends and be a downer… ",1,1,2025-11-07T07:14:44+00:00,https://reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/1oqnvez/back_to_being_alone/,Negative

i have no good friends, everyday i’m forced to fit in so that people treat me like i’m actually human, and I can’t go or move anywhere. i have zero aspirations, jobs, hobbies, sports, and/or extracurriculars. my family always makes me feel uncomfortable and there’s lots of yelling and conflict. i’m ugly, and nobody even tries to talk to me at all and everybody looks at me with disgust and all I do is get made fun of everyday. i didn’t even do anything to anybody, and everybody who i tried to be friends with talks behind my back. 

my grades are absolutely horrible, and my PSAT score was absolutely horrendous. i literally try my hardest every single day and I don’t even come close to people who don’t even try. every single day i try to be better but i always end up failing. everybody is so much more smarter and talented than me, and i try to catch up but i can never even come close to them. i try my hardest to be smart and i study for hours and days just for me to fail every single test. i have accommodations but i still can’t catch up or do anything.

i have no talents, no skills, no achievements, no money, nothing. everybody seems to be talented at one thing but i can’t even name one talent I have. everybody around me is so talented and has something they’re good at and i’m trying to find a skill or talent but i always fail in trying my hardest to achieve it. everybody has an achievement or accomplishments but i have absolutely none, and I don’t see myself getting any anytime soon.

nobody likes me at all. maybe i had one girlfriend, but all she did was exploit me, manipulate me, and cheat on me. she never actually really loved me, and she just wanted my attention and just wanted to exploit me. no girl will ever like me at all.

i honestly don’t know what to do, it seems like the only solution here is to just end my life.

I waited for three weeks for the owner of the place to be able to show me the place and in our conversation I didn't like the personality of the owner. The place is a good financial deal. 1300 a month including utilities for a fully furnished apartment. Earlier this year I was homeless and currently I'm living with family that I was homeless to not live with. They're good people but their home is toxic for me.

After my initial interaction with the owner of the place, I felt like as if the place is contaminated by her energy. So I called a friend to talk about it and my friend told me to get the place but the way he spoke involved making a lot of triggering noises that are the worst triggers for my misophonia and subsequently also my OCD. Now and for the past two days the the apartment has been embued in that essence. Just thinking about it triggers intrusive thoughts of him and the noises he made.

I want to get out of my parents home. I need to for my well being. I was looking forward to this great release and now it is completely ruined since I feel if I go there and sit in that place I'll be sitting in intrusive thoughts. I'll go from one struggle to another and never have peace. And I don't want to spend money on having to fight a battle. I need more time to process this, but I don't have time since the owner needs me to make a decision. I want to be able to feel about the place the way I did.

Since I was a kid, life never felt normal. There was always shouting, hitting, and chaos around me. My parents never gave me peace. I was sent to a boarding school when I was young, and even there, I never felt like I belonged anywhere.

While other kids were playing or talking about school stuff, I was just thinking about how to survive another day. I learned to stay quiet, to never ask for help, to never expect love.

My mother and father always took everything from me — even my money. Since I was 15, I’ve been working small jobs, and every time I tried to save something, they’d take it. I never got to buy anything for myself, never felt what it’s like to actually own something I earned.

Now I’m working again. I’m saving. I’ve got about 980 euros in my account right now, and for the first time, I’m not letting anyone touch it. I want to save up for a small studio — just a place where I can have peace.
Not a mansion, not luxury, just silence. My own space. Somewhere I can breathe and not feel like I owe anyone anything.

I don’t really talk to my family anymore. I don’t have anyone who asks me how I’m doing, or says “I’m proud of you.” I’m just trying to move forward, day by day, working, coming home, trying to stay positive.

Sometimes I wonder what it would be like to have a normal home, to sit at the table and laugh with family, to know that someone actually cares.
But I guess that’s not my life. My life is just surviving.

Still, I’m trying. I’m not perfect. I get angry, I get lost, but I still keep going.
Maybe one day I’ll find peace, maybe not.
But at least for now, I’m trying to build it with my own hands.",1,1,2025-11-07T06:05:14+00:00,https://reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/1oqmq46/im_only_18_but_my_soul_feels_way_older_than_my/,Positive

reddit,mentalhealth,1oqml03,_Elephantastic,f2ff7e2720f8a5e7,I feel insane,"A short background about myself (f, 25): I grew up with nothing out of the ordinary. However, I wasn't really social. Had a few friends on high school, but kept mostly to myself in my time off from school. Same for university.

Halfway through my bachelor's (during Covid) I got a room in at student housing with a few people. We were all new in the house, and it was great. Because of covid we were home a lot, had lots of parties, and I started dating one of my house mates. It felt like I finally understood how to enjoy life. It was the best year of my life so far.

However, we had to leave the house after a year, I stopped dating the guy, and my bachelors was finished.

Now the missing-out part starts... I didn't know what I wanted to do with my life, couldnt find a job with my BSc, couldn't stay close to my high-school friends. It felt like my life slowly startes to get worse. I found a new place to live, now with 5 other housemates. But as the time grew, I began isolating myself. Didn't cook in the kitchen anymore (but i love cooking and love food), sometimes didn't see my housemates for more than a month (while used to be kinda close).

Now I've found a new place to live with a friend of mine. But I feel like I'm not treating her wel... Avoiding her sometimes and keeping to myself too much. Furthermore: I'm still friends with the guy I was dating back in my first house, and still WAY too attached to him... Getting paranoid and jealous whenever he's hanging out with other girls. Probably because he's the only one I'm completely comfortable with, we still cuddle, and we have sex. Even after more than 4 years of not being together.

I'm SO panicking about what I should do with my life once he finds a girlfriend. I wouldn't know what to do anymore once that happens. I envision myself driving off the road so many times. I don't enjoy my life, not my social life (which i barely have), not my work. Feel like letting people down. Only feel satisfied with myself once I'm around him. I know it's not healthy...

Feel like going insane once I get the jealous-mode toggled on. Get freaking insane, psycho, hurt myself, break stuff, and will possible eventually kill the friendship I have with him, if not myself.

I know I shouldn't let myself go like that, but it feels like I can't help it. Not even after 4 years. I feel like going insane...

reddit,mentalhealth,1oqlt73,Anonymous746223,c90810299c5ce68c,Hypervigilance/ Anxiety / Brain damage ?,"I'm not used to writing on forums, but I really need help. I need to put words to my symptoms, which are truly bizarre. For a year now, my life has been hell following frequent use of MDMA and cannabis over a month-long period, and after some rather disturbing events where I argued with most of my friends due to episodes of paranoia, I admit. I consulted a psychiatrist who prescribed medication, but I stopped taking it because it didn't really have any effect on me; it just made me sleepier than anything else. To summarize, when I'm sitting in a group, or even just with a friend at home watching TV, or when I'm on my phone, every time someone makes the slightest movement—like raising an arm, moving their feet, or picking something up from the table—my eyes jump around as if to automatically follow the movement. It's a nightmare. 

At work, when I'm sitting with my colleagues around the table, every time they make the slightest movement, my eyes jump around as if they're observing the gesture, and it's involuntary. But when I'm alone, it doesn't happen. Furthermore, when I'm sitting at work, for example, at my computer, every time someone passes in my peripheral vision, instead of being focused on my task, my eyes dart about and automatically follow the person passing by out of the corner of my eye. It's gotten to the point where people don't even want to approach my desk anymore; they come up behind me to talk. Recently, I've also noticed that when I'm in a group with friends and I'm talking to one of them, looking them in the eye, while another person is standing next to them, instead of naturally looking at my conversation partner, my eyes seem to be glancing at the other person out of the corner of my eye. 

Now, because of this, even on the street or in confined spaces, when I walk past a group, I'm glancing at them out of the corner of my eye instead of keeping my gaze and attention fixed on the person I'm talking to. Basically, I'm either constantly watching people out of my eye or my eyes are constantly jumping around, reacting to every movement. I also forgot to mention that now, every time someone looks at me, my eyes constantly avoid eye contact, even if they turn around to face me. I'm fully aware of my symptoms; I don't have hallucinations or delusions. My behavior has completely changed because of this damn disease.",1,0,2025-11-07T05:13:56+00:00,https://reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/1oqlt73/hypervigilance_anxiety_brain_damage/,Negative

reddit,mentalhealth,1oql0qn,Ok_Grapefruit8093,9aad2c5f85888ac8,Discouraged from finding therapist,"For well over a year I've been back and forth about therapy. I knew I needed it, but I really struggle with opening up to people which is why I've avoided it for so long. To add on, in high school I didn't have the best experience with their ""mental health services."" They had this social worker they'd have me meet every week but she just made me feel embarassed, ashamed, and I left those sessions probably feeling worse than when I came in.

About 3 months ago I finally built up the courage to reach out to my university's mental health center. The guy that called me for an initial consultation was super friendly, however about a week later I decided to transfer to another school because the last one wasn't a good fit, meaning I no longer had access to their free services.

A bit later, I reached out to two therapists. For one of them, their front desk worker called me then just went on and on about the traumatizing experiences their family members had when they served in the military, then talked about how people in the military have to carry so many more hardships than the average person. I'm not denying that, but she assumed I myself was in the military because of the insurance I'm under when really I was just a regular college student lol. The other therapist I reached out to called and I was about to meet with her when my living situation completely flipped around. I ended up moving back home so I was no longer near her office.

Afterwards I tried emailing a counseling center near where I'm currently living but the emails just aren't sending through. Went online to their website and filled out a form, they never replied. So I tried reaching out to two more therapists in my area but one just hasn't replied in 5 days and the other said they aren't accepting new clients. I'm just getting really discouraged, and while I could try calling the counseling center it just causes me so much anxiety thinking about it (which is why online therapy sessions aren't ideal for me). I'll eventually call them, but for now I just wanted to vent about how discouraging this all is.

I don't have too many options as I'm under a certain insurance, so whenever I look on Psychology today there's not many I can choose from that I feel would be a good fit for me. I don't expect to find an amazing therapist right away, but I think one more negative experience with therapy will just completely put me off again for who knows how long.

reddit,mentalhealth,1oqkriu,Lovegood_15,0a00a2e10b6750a9,Do you ever feel like you're afraid to be happy?,"This might not make any sense. But I constantly feel that I shouldn't be too happy or I'm not allowed to be so. I know the reason, but don't know how to get out of it.

I was born in Asia, now reside in Canada. Since I was small, my family's financial situation wasn't great and I was aware of it. I tried to study hard like my parents always told me to, so that I could get a degree, find a job and make money myself. 

Luckily, I was a good student, and managed to get a scholarship to study abroad. But because living in a Western country is expensive, my parents offered to help with some small living expenses throughout my 2 years of study. Perhaps this is when things turn the wrong way.

I have a younger brother, who wasn't that into studying. He seemed to be more of a free spirit. I actually always thought, I wanted to follow a stable, planed life path, making money to help my parents, so he can follow his dream.

My brother, however, decided to get married early because he made his girlfriend pregnant. Because of that he couldn't finish his school. Their life after that wasn't good, they were broke without a proper job (he worked part time and his wife was unemployed), and with a small baby.

My brother started asking me for money. Every month, every week. And one day I became exhausted so I told him I didn't want to be his ATM anymore. He then told me, it's me who owed him. Because I went abroad, I took away the money that my parents supposed to spend for him. That's why now he wanted that money back for his son.

I was shocked, hurt, in denial. I can't believe my brother could say such a thing to me. He had always been a good little brother. Since when he changed to be such a mean person? But then, apparently what he said slowly crept into my mind, becoming a guilt deep down that left a scar forever.

I became to think that, perhaps I actually took his chance, took what should belong to him. I started sending money to him again. My father was aware of that, so he stepped in, told me to stop as he could support my brother. But I feel so sad. My parents worked hard their whole life, and I wanted them to retire without a burden, but now they might have to work until my brother's baby grows up.

Sometimes, if I wasn't able to send my brother money, I would find myself explain for no reason, like how difficult I was (because I had a mortgage after marriage, because I split every expense with my husband, I never told him that I sent money to my brother). Like I do know I don't need to explain anything if I don't want to give someone money. But why did I still do that? Because I was afraid he would misunderstood, that I had a lot of money but I just wanted to selfishly keep it my own.

Now, every time I feel happy, immediately a thought would come to me: No, I can't be too happy, if I'm happy, he would think I ignored his difficult life, the life that was difficult because I took his chance.

It traumatised me, every single day. I can't cut him off, because my parents are still there. But I don't know how long more this would be. Would he stop when his child grows up a bit more? Would he stop if one day he finds a better job?

How can I ever feel happiness again?",1,0,2025-11-07T04:17:58+00:00,https://reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/1oqkriu/do_you_ever_feel_like_youre_afraid_to_be_happy/,Negative

reddit,mentalhealth,1oqkfsm,happens_alot,157a153475063358,I ended a 3-year relationship to focus on myself… now he’s seeing someone and I’m struggling badly.”,"I (19F) and my ex (20M) were together for three years. It was genuinely a beautiful, loving relationship, and for a long time I thought we were meant for each other. We did long-distance for 2 years, and he visited once a year. His parents knew about us, mine didn’t.
This August, I ended the relationship.
Not because I stopped loving him, but because I had big goals and dreams, and I truly believed the relationship was limiting me. After the second year, I also started lying to him about small things — not because I wanted to betray him, but because he didn’t like certain things I wanted to do, and being honest started causing fights. He wasn’t abusive, but he was pretty strict about things, and I started feeling controlled.
He, on the other hand, was very loyal and very honest. That made the guilt worse.
When I broke up with him, we agreed on a mutual note:
Someday, when I’ve worked on myself and sorted my life, maybe we’d find our way back to each other.
This gave me a lot of comfort.
It has now been three months, and I’m struggling much more than I expected. I started self-harming after the breakup, and I felt like the only person who could calm me or make me stop was him. So I reached out.
He told me he’s seeing someone new.
Not talking stage — he genuinely likes her.
He also said he’s sure this isn’t a rebound.
It broke me.
I’m completely alone in this. I don’t have anyone I can talk to, while he always had friends around him. Knowing that he’s moved on while I’m falling apart has made it 10x more painful.
Right now, I just want this pain to stop. I don’t know how to move on. I don’t know how to handle the guilt, the loneliness, the regret, and the shock of him already liking someone else.
How do I move on from this? How do I stop feeling like this?

reddit,mentalhealth,1oqkdz9,doitmyway1,8708068308879371,For someone who meant the world to me,"It’s been a few weeks since everything fell apart, but honestly, it feels like I’m still stuck in that moment, the one where everything changed. Since that day, I’ve been trying my best to keep myself occupied, to distract my mind from wandering down those familiar lanes that always lead back to her. But no matter what I do, it’s just not enough. 

I go out for a stroll in the evening, hoping the air might clear my head. But as I pass the small corner near my house, my eyes land on the plant I had planted for her cat, the one that passed away last year. I remember how broken she was, and how I had promised to keep something alive in her cat’s memory. That little plant still stands there, quietly thriving, as if unaware that the person it was meant for is no longer part of my world. Everywhere I go, I find pieces of her scattered around my life. The simplest of things have now turned into painful reminders of someone who doesn’t even want to talk to me anymore.

It’s strange how someone can become your safe place one day, and a source of endless pain the next. I’ve tried to dive into work, to pick up hobbies, to meet people, honestly anything that could help me feel a little less hollow. But the silence she left behind has a weight of its own. It follows me everywhere, in every room, every playlist, every memory that surfaces when I least expect it. I keep replaying our conversations in my head, the laughter, the plans, the promises that were never really promises, but felt like them at the time. Maybe I read too much into her words. Maybe I built a world that only I was living in. And yet, knowing that doesn’t make the ache go away.

I’ve been struggling with sleep lately. It’s like my mind won’t shut off, no matter how exhausted I feel. I lie there in the dark, thinking about everything about her, about us, about what went wrong. Sometimes, I can almost feel her presence, like she’s still there next to me, but then I realize she’s not, and it only makes things worse. It’s strange, how the quiet of the night can feel so loud when you’re trying to drown out the thoughts that keep you awake. I keep thinking about the day she said she’d make me her handmade brownies. She was so excited about it, talking about how she had perfected the recipe, how she couldn’t wait to see my reaction. It’s a small thing, but I remember how I could almost taste the sweetness in her voice when she said it, how it felt like she wanted to do something special for me. It was one of those moments where everything felt right, like she cared. And now, that simple gesture has become a ghost of something I’ll never get to experience.

I’ve been trying to find peace, but peace doesn’t come easy when your heart is still searching for answers it may never get. Still, despite it all, a part of me still hopes she’s doing okay and that she’s sleeping well, she’s eating on time (she skips meals left, right and centre 🥹), that she’s finding joy in small things, that she’s healing too. And maybe, someday, when time has softened the edges of this pain, I’ll look back and be grateful, not for the heartbreak, but for having known someone who could make me feel this deeply in the first place. I still, and always will, care for her. ",1,0,2025-11-07T03:58:42+00:00,https://reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/1oqkdz9/for_someone_who_meant_the_world_to_me/,Positive
reddit,mentalhealth,1oqk929,farwaaaaaay,d626d27d2c92b7cd,I think it’s more than anxiety,"I’ll be seeing a psychologist soon for issues that have reoccurred all my adult life. As a kid I had social anxiety and always felt rejected and outcast. At lunch I would yap absurd things that put people off and had ideas that made them think I was on drugs. But it excited me because people laughed at the jokes. I got beat on and choked at home and parents always fight so I isolated a lot. I didn’t “get” it. I’d just find a hobby like game dev and get obsessed thinking I was gonna change the world and I was created by god to do this thing. Or that I’d make it big and have a lot of dedication and “soul stuff”. I isolated and got paranoid and lived off the excitement that my vision would come through but that others didn’t get it. It’s how I coped with lacking social skills.

Now as an adult I’ve repeatedly done that and became loud and arrogant to cope with anxiety then would be alone drinking every day. Always working something new I think will change everything for me, getting paranoid my friends and family are hating me and out to get me. Recently I’ve had drunk outbursts with new friends and decided to start listening to them. Usually everything feels like an attack and they pointed out I get so angry and mad. I was also falling for a girl and getting really angry and yelling at her for being avoidant and realized it’s likely actually just a personal issue and not everyone is trying to do me bad. Had a near full anxiety attack early this week and have been feeling empathy and my friends say I’ve been chill now. Just a week ago one friend said I’m the most unchill person they e ever met. Now I sorta see how my behaviour affects people. But I feel vulnerable and like I’m a kid again and everything feels feint and even my vision feels less heavy. I’m just worried I won’t make this change permanent and go back to my old state to cope. I’m also zoning out less where I stare into space even in conversation with raving thoughts. It’s like I’m magically cured in some ways",1,0,2025-11-07T03:51:31+00:00,https://reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/1oqk929/i_think_its_more_than_anxiety/,Negative

I became a dog trainer and love it. Ive had a partner who i honestly dont deserve for a year. I finally stopped constantly worrying about people I love and care about. I still worried for them but not to the point that it consumed me. Most of all I finally stopped telling myself that its my fault the people I care about get hurt. And sure I still had some times where i couldnt do anything. But lo and behold, today I get a call saying my grandma has been in a car accident. My only remaining grandparent, who supported me coming out as trans as soon as i came out. Who brought up wanting to get matching tattoos to honor my late grandfather. A woman that truly this world does not deserve because she is so kind and charitable. This beautiful soul had been in a car accident and now has a brain bleed and broken ribs. I was having a good day. I was getting out of the rut id been in. I was cleaning my apartment because I just didnt have the energy for it before. Then I get a call from my dad telling me what happened. I know she'll be okay but I just cant stop myself from going to the worst possible outcome. If she died I couldn't continue. Ive already lost so many people. I can barely handle hearing that someone I love went to the hospital for a couple of stitches. Im stuck in a prison of my own fears. I was getting out and now im suddenly back with the door closed. Im stuck remaining all the times I've watched my late mom or grandma hooked up to machines as their time runs out. Im back to being a 12 year old kid hearing my mom say ""I love you"" for the last time without knowing it was the last time until she was put in the ground. Im forcing my eyes open so I dont have to see it when I close my eyes. I know its completely irrational thinking. I know that I shouldn't be freaking out when we dont have all the details yet but I dont know what else to do. My experiences with hospitals have mostly been losing or nearly losing people.

I’m bipolar/major depressive/chronic anxiety/ptsd/borderline depending on what drs notes and diagnoses you look at. Personally, I think it’s more bipolar, which is what I was originally diagnosed with in 2001. Lately I’ve been spiraling so deeply out of control. I see it. I know what I’m doing, but I have no control over it does that make sense? It’s like I’m watching myself on a movie screen. 

I was Baker acted two years ago almost to the day when I really wasn’t having an episode. I was just upset because my friend boyfriend ruined my birthday and broke my windshield and when I called the police, they decided with him and gave him a ride home rather than pressing charges for him destroying my property because“that’s what insurance is for“. But because I was upset because this man ruined my birthday and shattered my windshield I was sent to the fruit farm on my birthday.

I lost my job five months ago, I’m drowning in debt, I’m about to lose my car, I’m about to lose all of my belongings in storage because that’s where I had to put everything when I lost my housing. I want to get help. I know I need impatient treatment . But without a job or insurance the only place I can go is where I went when I was baker acted. I would not send a stray rabbit, mangy dog there. I sat in admission for 16 hours without food, freezing to death. When I finally was “admitted” I was only allowed a hospital gown. They kept the floor like 56°. It was freezing. When I woke up, I tried to take my blanket and they wouldn’t let me have it. It’s a very small facility. There was one TV that had on kids shows. I’m asthmatic and I was denied an inhaler and when I asked the nurse for access to inhaler and she could hear me visibly wheezing I was berated and belittled. There was patients who were in psychosis walking up and down the halls, talking to themselves smacking themselves.

The food… The one girl I talked to in there said jail food was better. It was a very traumatic experience. The only reason I was sent there was because of an asshole cop. How does someone get away with vandalizing and clearly destroying someone’s property who is hammered get a ride home and the person who was driving them to their home but stopped on the side of the road to call for help once this person became aggressive and destroyed their property get sent to the fruit farm?

I’m about to take the sewer slide ride. I sleep all day and I’m up all night. I have no energy. I have no motivation. I cry all the time. My room is a disgusting hoarder pigsty. I’ve reached out to my family and they don’t care. I don’t have any friends. I am so alone. I would not wish this life on my worst enemy. I used to be so happy and full of life and a good mom.

Last year I made about 20000 dollars and I’ve helped them out with this money and I’ve lost some at the same time business started to slow down until I got nothing to my name and now I just feel lost and the arguments and constant pressure I get from them is not helping at all so I just gave up and stay silent to avoid causing any trouble or make things worse, I was even told to stop smoking weed which I did and the only time my fathers speak to me is when he wants to scold me or when his making a joke, I don’t remember when I had a real normal conversation with him and my mother keeps on telling me when I’m in my room it’s like I’m in a dark hole and that she’s worried about me and that she’s has bad dreams about me. I don’t know what to do anymore, is it time for me to leave this earth to make everyone else in my life better because all of this just makes me feel like I’m a problem, I just be in my own world.",1,0,2025-11-07T02:08:39+00:00,https://reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/1oqi4sl/i_dont_know_what_to_do/,Negative
reddit,mentalhealth,1oqcx8b,PsychoPrism,b30290f61aa73333,"Is it just me, or is pop-psychology completely drowning out actual psychology?","Hello everyone,

I'm a psychology student, and I've been thinking about a question I wanted to bring to this community: why does pop or pseudo-psychology seem to be the dominant public face of our field?

It's a phenomenon that doesn't seem to happen to the same degree in other sciences. Social media feeds are saturated with vague ""self-improvement"" content, where complex terms like ""trauma"" and ""narcissism"" are used very loosely. Personality quizzes are often treated as settled science, and you see a lot of content about manipulating others using so-called ""dark"" psychology.

It feels overwhelmingly unscientific.

We have a legacy of this in our own history. While Freud was undoubtedly influential and game-changing, much of his work was untestable. It's Wilhelm Wundt who is considered the father of experimental psychology. This current trend feels like a modern version of that, but amplified by social media.

To use an analogy from other fields: It would be like if phrenology was the popular face of neuroscience, homeopathy the loudest voice in medicine, or flat-earth,the most popular theory in physics.

I understand that reading dense academic texts isn't for everyone. But it's troubling that well-researched concepts, like the Big Five personality model, are often drowned out by less scientific ideas.

As students and professionals in the field, does anyone else find this frustrating? What are your thoughts on why this happens and how we can better communicate the science of our field to the public?",2,1,2025-11-06T22:22:50+00:00,https://reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/1oqcx8b/is_it_just_me_or_is_poppsychology_completely/,Positive

Always counting down the hours or minutes until the next day or the next thing in general. In addition to this, I take pictures of literally everything I do, especially fun things, because i guess I worry I’ll forget about them or that maybe it’ll be the last time anything like it happens. Every single day I check my recent images and essentially relive the previous moments and days. I just read online that taking pictures can actually impair your memories, and I assume looking at pics and videos of those memories taken from a slightly different angle from my eyes is also compromising, but I just feel like I need to do it.  I’d really hate to lose these memories because that’s the opposite of what I’m trying to do by recording everything. Surely this isn’t a good thing, but I really don’t know what to even think about it or do about it. If anyone reads this or somehow does something similar I’d love to hear about it. Thanks.

reddit,mentalhealth,1oqhogx,Competitive_Run_7652,16b0de96e5fd697e,i thought i was depressed and lazy. turns out ive just been mentally overloaded with low composure.,"For the longest time I thought I was the problem. I’d wake up foggy, drained, and constantly behind on everything. My brain felt slow — like everyone else was moving at 2x speed and I just couldn’t keep up, no matter how hard I tried.

I kept calling myself lazy. Unfocused. Maybe even depressed. And I kept pushing anyway — more caffeine, more lists, more forcing myself through days that felt heavier than they should’ve been.

A few weeks ago I started using this site that tracks your mental patterns from journaling. I’d write a few lines every day, and it would analyse things like my mood, stress levels, and overall mental load.

After a couple of weeks the pattern was embarrassingly clear: my mental load was *high every single day*. The site literally flagged “constant overload.” Not depression. Not laziness. Just a brain running on fumes for way too long.

And honestly? Seeing it laid out like that made everything click. That feeling of always being behind wasn’t a lack of effort — it was burnout.

So I finally stopped pushing. Took a short break. Went away for a bit. Slept properly. Let myself breathe. And now I genuinely feel lighter and sharper than I have in months.

If you’ve ever felt like you’re constantly “not keeping up” but can’t explain why — yeah, you’re not the only one. And it’s not always your fault. 💗",1,0,2025-11-07T01:47:31+00:00,https://reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/1oqhogx/i_thought_i_was_depressed_and_lazy_turns_out_ive/,Negative

1. Separate facts from feelings

“She says you’re lazy” ≠ “you are lazy.”
Her statement is not a fact — it is her emotion.

2. Do not fuse with her labels

Her words reflect her state, not your identity.

3. Name the pattern

“This is her old reaction pattern, not a description of me.”

4. Challenge catastrophizing

“You’ll die, you’re useless” = her emotional catastrophizing.

5. You cannot fix her worldview

Acceptance reduces suffering more than arguing.

6. Hold two truths together

“I understand her suffering,”
and
“She is being unfair,”
can both be true.

7. Notice your own triggers

“My chest tightens when she speaks — that’s an old wound being touched.”

8. Mindful distance

Emotional distance ≠ coldness; it’s protection.

9. You can disagree silently

“I don’t accept this definition of me.”

10. Reaffirm your identity

Say to yourself:
“I am growing; I am not her criticism.”

reddit,depression,doqwow,SQLwitch,bd59b8d64e392720,"Our most-broken and least-understood rules is ""helpers may not invite private contact as a first resort"", so we've made a new wiki to explain it","We understand that most people who reply immediately to an OP with an invitation to talk privately  mean only to help, but this type of response usually leads to either disappointment or disaster.  it usually works out quite differently here than when you say ""PM me anytime"" in a casual social context.  

We have huge admiration and appreciation for the goodwill and good citizenship of so many of you who support others here and flag inappropriate content - even more so because we know that so many of you are struggling yourselves.  We're hard at work behind the scenes on more information and resources to make it easier to give and get quality help here - this is just a small start.  

Our new wiki page explains in detail why it's much better to respond in public comments, at least until you've gotten to know someone.  It will be maintained at /r/depression/wiki/private_contact, and the full text of the current version is below.

*****

###Summary###

**Anyone who, while acting as a helper, invites or accepts private contact (I.e. PMs, chat, or any kind of offsite communication) early in the conversion is showing either bad intentions or bad judgement.  Either way, it's unwise to trust them.** 


""PM me anytime"" seems like a kind and generous offer. And it might be perfectly well-meaning, but, unless and until a solid rapport has been established, it's just not a wise idea.  Here are some points to consider before you offer or accept an invitation to communicate privately.

* **By posting supportive replies publicly, you'll help more people than just the OP. If your responses are of good quality, you'll educate and inspire other helpers.** [The 1-9-90 rule](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1%25_rule_(Internet_culture\)) applies here as much as it does anywhere else on the internet.  

* People who are struggling with serious mental-health issues often (justifiably) have a low tolerance for disappointment and a high-level of ever-changing emotional need. **Unless the helper is able to make a 100% commitment to be there for them in every way, for as long as necessary, offering a personal inbox as a resource is likely to do more harm than good.** This is why mental-health crisis-line responders usually don't give their names and callers aren't allowed to request specific responders.  It's much healthier and safer for the callers to develop a relationship with the agency as a whole.  Analogously, it's much safer and healthier for our OPs to develop a relationship with the community as a whole.  Even trained responders are generally not allowed to work high-intensity situations alone.  It's partly about availability, but it's mostly about wider perspective and preventing compassion fatigue. 

* **If a helper gets in over their head with someone whose mental-health issues (including suicidality, which is often comorbid with depression) escalate, in a PM conversation it's much harder for others, including the /r/depression and /r/SuicideWatch moderators to help**.  (Contrary to common assumptions, moderators can't see or police PMs.)  

* In our observation over many years, the people who say ""PM me"" the most are consistently the ones with the least understanding of mental-health issues and mental-health support. We all have gaps in our knowledge and in our ability to communicate effectively.  Community input mitigates these limitations. **There's no reason why someone who's truly here to help would want to hide their responses from community scrutiny**.  If helpers are concerned about their own privacy, keep in mind that self-disclosure, when used supportively, is more about the feelings than the details, and that we have no problem here with the use of alt/throwaway accounts, and have no restrictions on account age or karma.  

*  We all know the internet is used by some people to exploit or abuse others.  These people *do* want to hide their deceptive and manipulative responses from everyone except their victims. There are many of them who specifically target those who are vulnerable because of mental-health issues. **If a helper invites an OP to talk privately and gives them a good, supportive experience, they've primed that person to be more vulnerable to abusers.** This sort of cognitive priming tends to be particularly effective when someone's in a state of mental-health crisis, when people rely more on heuristics than critical reasoning.

* If OPs want to talk privately, posting on a wide-open anonymous forum like reddit might not be the best option. Although we don't recommend it, we do allow OPs to request private contact when asking for support. If you want to do this, please keep your expectations realistic, and to have a careful look at the history of anyone who offers to PM before opening up to them.",2361,177,2019-10-29T14:52:02+00:00,https://reddit.com/r/depression/comments/doqwow/our_mostbroken_and_leastunderstood_rules_is/,Negative

If you're having a tough time but prefer not to make your own post, or have an accomplishment you want to talk about (these aren't allowed standalone posts in the sub as they violate the ""role model"" rule),  this is a place you can share.

-----

Our subreddit rules are very different from most of the rest of reddit!  Since all of them exist for important reasons, we ask everyone here to read and follow them. Please click 'report' on any harmful content you see here - we always want to know and deal as soon as we can.

We also have several resource wikis for help with finding and giving support:

https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/wiki/what_is_depression provides guidance about what is and isn't a depressive disorder, guidance on the complex nature of the illnesses that are usually grouped under the ""depression"" label, and redirect information for common off-topic issues.

https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/wiki/giving_help offers information on the nature and value of peer support for mental-health issues in general, and lots of guidance for learning what is -- and isn't -- usually helpful in giving peer support.

YSK that the types of rule violations that we most frequently see here are:

- People breaking the private contact rule. You should never trust anyone who tries to get you into a private conversation in response to a post here. See https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/wiki/private_contact

- ""I'm here to help"" posts. This shows that you don't understand the most basic principles of peer support, especially selectivity. The ""giving help"" wiki explains more about this.

- Role modelling, i.e. ""achievement"" or ""advice"" posts. This is an expert-free zone -- that's what peer support means (rule 5). We know that ""internet culture"" celebrate not just bragging about your achievements but bragging about your intentions.  Neither is ever acceptable here in any form.  

- Content that's more about 'making a statement' or casually polling the sub than seeking personal support  (rules 1, 2 and 10).

- Off-topic posts about difficult situations, including interpersonal issues. Grief, sadness, anger, loneliness and other difficult emotions are not mental illnesses. **Feelings that can be explained by person's circumstances are perfectly healthy no matter how painful they are. A depressive** ***disorder*** **only exists when someone's mood is out of synch with what's going on for them.** The ""what is depression"" wiki linked above has suggestions for other places to post about these issues, which are 100% valid and serious but do NOT belong here.",2,2,2025-11-04T22:53:54+00:00,https://reddit.com/r/depression/comments/1oom3z4/checkin_post_with_essential_information_about_our/,Negative

I never would have had sex with you, never would have given my body to you if I had known that you would turn around and use that as a reason to say I don’t deserve love.

We love eachother very much but I have always struggled with mental illness and emotional regulation. She knows this. I've never been good at dealing with negative or strong feelings and have always turned to self-injurious behaviours (SH and ED which I am mostly recovered from).

Recently we have been having some issues. I have chronic migraines and was fired from my long time job due to descrimination (currently in a legal battle as well over this). It's hard on her because she has to worry about finances and is worried about me when I'm sick. I have a seasonal job now and hope to get a new FT job soon but still... she has expressed how hard it is on her and we argue at least once a month over this.

I feel like her life would be better without me. I cry and cry and I don't tell her why... I worry so much it will come off as manipulative. It's loud and I've had to stop myself many times. I don't know how to tell her. 

I don't want to die but I really want this pain to stop. Both physically and mentally. I can't handle negative and stressful experiences as I never learned how to in a healthy way. Not to mention experiencing chronic debilitating pain frequently. I need help but it's expensive. I want to tell her but what if it comes off as manipulative??

Not sure if anyone has had similar situations. How would you go about this if you were me? In addition, are there any recommendations on reading material etc on how to help regulate emotions?

A little over a year ago I was told I ""needed"" 4 root canals by a dentist. For about a half of that time I had no health insurance and when I did have a plan I was paying $300 for out of pocket they didn't cover anything. So I was looking at $6,000 out of pocket. I finally got a better insurance plan and was able to see my old dentist, who assured me that I only need 2, and the other ones are filled in (by him about 4ish years ago) and if I'm not in pain then there is no reason to remove the fillings and do a root canal. I'm not in pain in the area where the other dentist told me I needed these root canals so I felt better. But of course, now that I have better insurance it's impossible to find an endodontist that has open appointments. I've called so many dentist offices, the soonest appointment I can get is in January and that is still just for a consultation. I am SO tired of being in pain. The pain has gotten to the point now where I can't eat. I've been only drinking liquids and eating any soft foods I can for the padt 2 weeks. I am miserable. I feel worn down and tired all the time, I'm pretty sure from not eating. I feel like doctors don't care. No one cares. I can't be in pain until January. I literally can not take this anymore and the thought of suicide has been on my mind for the last month. I seriously can't imagine going another month like this.

I always thought about killing myself. I grew up, joined the military and kept pushing on. Almost constantly I thought about suicide though. I believed getting married and having a family was what gave people fulfillment and joy. I left the military and was married and had a child. Post portum hit me bad as well as trauma of sa in the military.
I have been married for 15 years trying to dedicate myself to my family. Still the suicidal thoughts just went with me. Treatments, therapy, and meds, but now I believe it is a pattern of thought that comes still to this day. 
Recently I suddenly began to feel hopeless. My husband is volatile and emotional, my child loves me more then the world because her daddy is mean and I am the glue of the family. I don't want to be. I have no friends left (due to military and moving, then just had a hard time meeting people who are just good) and family is all out of state. I still want to die. It distresses me more now that I have a family. I can't die because of them and I feel like I messed up trying so hard to find normality. I am just here to make other people feel better and support my family that couldn't function without me.
I am falling more apart physically and mentally recently and my husband is just angry with me and I am scared to kill myself now because I had a child. I don't know if I need advice. I know I am a nice person, and I don't like that about myself. Seems like being a selfish person is easier to me. I made tons of different plans and researched ways to kill myself through the years. I am in therapy and I become more empty feeling than depressed now.

Im noticing things.
Im realizing things.
Im not a fan of these things.


It is like my eyes have slowly began to focus and bring in the whole picture.

I have been in a depression without realizing it, while making and living very important life decisions, creating lives, building a new life , and then slowly letting it fall apart from neglect, impulse purchases, knee jerk reactions, complete lack of organizational skills, or even really care. 

I am sitting here realizing what depression really is and has always not been what I was raised up being told it was. 

I see all the patterns, the bad decisions, the thoughtless actions, and more that led to here.
I have stupid debt, not stupid high, but stupid based.
Typical CCD of course, and usual revolving accounts, and then car payments, normal other pay to live beyond smart means stupid debt....

Child support was raised even higher when the older aged out. Yes I know, thats a xost of life expenditure,  but damn, 1200 bucks a month still hurts right? 

But I also ha e the really stupid date.

Pay in four..
Afterpay
Klarna
Affirm

You get the idea.....fekkin stupid debt for stupid people like me. 

I live no life. I wake up, go to work, do very little actual work besides just sit in a slump at my desk like some semi comatose jackass up until its time to leave, then I clock out and go home.
Home is where I just sit with my equally depressed wife In our equally depressing and unkempt home hardly doing anything productive at all until its bed time.

Then fucking lather, rinse, and repeat bitches because its fucking groundhog day and your doing it all over again. 

I have literally hit crisis mode. I see everything I have just screwed all to hell and I not only know where to start, but exactly where in this rubbish heap of life that is mine shall I begin?

Going on dates. That kind of crap. And growing up, I always believed that would be the case. But now I’m 9 months away from being 20 and not a shred of that dream has happened. And I feel like the only one. I have been interested in maybe 30 girls since I was 13 (small middle school, even smaller high school.) Not only was there a zero percent success rate in even getting one date, and I have never had mutual feelings with anybody, but nearly all of them had a boyfriend. Way to help my self-esteem. As if being autistic didn’t depress me enough. I’m at least five years behind everyone else socially. And at this rate I’ll end up being a real life 40-year old virgin. Maybe even die alone with my parents gone and my brothers carrying on the family bloodline (one of them is 13 and already has had a girlfriend so I’m sure he’ll be fine in that regard.)

I know what you might want to say. “You’re so young, this time should be for working on yourself.” I also know it’s not good to look for happiness in a woman. But I feel like I’ve robbed myself of a key experience. I suppose the only positive is that I’ve never had to go through a breakup either. If that happened I’d probably never try again. Become even more angry at women than I already am. Turn to porn ten times more than I already use it. Let go of myself, since I’ve only been lifting for two years to feel more attractive.

I Did an awful job explaining my situation im sorry to ever had to read that..i just want to be able to have a life even if i dont end up driving or working i want to be happy.

Naturally, this includes my ability to function in school. But before this term started I contacted disability services to receive the accomodations I am eligible for.

Without proper accomadations or support, and with how crushing my depression is I had been falling behind in assignments, nearly failing the class. My teacher reached out saying that it would be better if I just dropped the class, so it doesn't affect my GPA. I replied telling them about my circumstances, how they affect my ability to get work done and even asked if there was anything we could do to make it more manageable for me, even that I would still work to the best of my ability despite my conditions. But not only did they not acknowledge any of the things that I said in my email, refusing to give any more accomodations or help they insisted that I drop the class anyway.

Every term, I've gone through some sort of depressive episode, but in my first two terms, I managed to recover and even get straight A's. This term feels completely different, and I feel like I'll literally fail every single one of my courses.

But even then, I can't get myself to do anything. I've been lying in bed all day almost every day for the last month. I can barely get up and eat, or shower, or do the laundry, or wash my teeth. I've gone to uni like 5 times during this time, and have missed like 90% of assignments and projects. My teachers have started sending me emails, warning me that I might not be able to catch up.

This is insane to me. I have never in my life gotten a grade under a B, so being faced with the threat of actually failing EVERY SINGLE COURSE is just... I don't even know how to describe it. It's not even about the grades or me feeling incapable or whatever. It's about the fact that I'm an international student. 

Living here is NOT cheap and I'm literally a parasite to my parents who are working their asses off to give me a better education and life. If I fail everything, that's a one-year setback that my parents are probably not able to afford. I might have to move back in with my parents, and then it would have all been in vain. I will have made my parents spend all their savings and time on this. I'll never be able to emigrate again. This is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity and I'm wasting it just like that.

I'm so sick and tired of everything. All I've done lately is scroll on ig reels, cry, and sleep. I'm stuck. And to top it off, I had a counseling appointment for tomorrow that they just told me had to be canceled. It was everything I was hoping might get me unstuck. I'm so fucked. I'm so, so fucked.

reddit,depression,1oqkbn8,Cheap-Safe,ce5ebed42fda1ce4,Can’t get out of bed..,"Hi, idk how to make this short. Seems like a lot.. I recently found out that I have ADHD - inattentive type at 30 years old. I’m also a female, my doc said that type is very common in women. Apparently I’ve had it most of my life. It was a tough thing to learn about myself. It was good because now I know my problem and I can start treating it to get better, and it was bad because I’ve gone my whole life starting and never finishing things and constantly quitting. I feel like I’ve wasted 30 years of my life. So I feel like that’s adding on to my depression if that makes sense. 

I started taking adderall a week ago. It definitely helps me stay focused and awake/aware, but that’s about it. It doesn’t help me get up in the morning and get to work. I was naively thinking it would help me with that. I wish I could be like normal people and just start the day, but that alone is a huge task for me. I wake up in a weird mood everyday. I don’t want to get up and start the day, I just want to stay in bed and sleep more. Sometimes I tell myself that I just want to sleep until I’m not sleepy anymore, but maybe that’s not possible. I slept about 14hrs yesterday, kind of using sleep as an excuse to avoid life. But I’m also very confused about it because I don’t understand why the hell I’m so sleepy all the time. I recently got labs done and have low iron. Not extremely low. Doc wants me taking iron every other day. Everything else seems fine. So per my pcp and psychiatrist, it seems like I have depression. I did multiple evals and they diagnosed me with depression and ADHD multiple times. I just have the fear of starting antidepressants and not being able to get off of them when I need it or even the possibility of them making me a “zombie” like I hear a lot of people talking about. I feel like I’m already behaving like a zombie with me not being able to get out of bed, but during all of this, I’m still me. I like being me but I guess I really need to change. 

I just want something that will help me get out of bed in the morning and start the day. Is that something that any of you have struggled with? Have your meds helped with that at all? I’ve lost the past few weeks of paychecks because I just can’t get up. I’ve tried sleeping super early, I’ve tried sleep all day the day before work, I’ve tried energy drinks and focus gummies and now adderall. Adderall is helpful. I worked well for a couple days with it but now I’m back to the point where I just can’t get out of bed and it’s ruining my life. I’m ruining my life. So upset with myself. 

I have another appointment with my psychiatrist Monday and just want to be prepared. He says he wants me to try antidepressants. I hope I can be fixed somehow. It feels like I can’t do it alone and will definitely need meds. But have any of you experienced this and had success with any meds? I’m not asking for medical advice or anything.. I hope this post follows all the rules. I would just love to know if anyone else has gone through this.",2,2,2025-11-07T03:55:18+00:00,https://reddit.com/r/depression/comments/1oqkbn8/cant_get_out_of_bed/,Negative

reddit,depression,1oqjjc0,Legitimate_Figure287,5b2e111cd397a454,Does depression ever really get better? What kind of additional treatments for CPTSD and treatment resistant MDD are there that is actually helpful for people? (Other then medication and psychotherapy),"TW:  suicide, abuse, self harm

I really really want to get better. I need to get better becuase I need to stay alive. For the longest time I was not willing to put in the effort to get better, but I am willing to do anything to feel happier. I just dont know how to do that.

I have been struggling with severe MDD, unspecified eating disorder, bpd, adhd and RAD. COVID is really what set off my depression, self harm and active suicidal thoughts. I had very abusive parents my whole childhood (physical and emotional) but during COVID, I had no escape whatsoever, my mental health went down. I had always been a sad and quiet and passively suicidal because of what happened at home, with the thought that it would get better one day, but when I was 15 it all got worse and I began to stop having hope. I also ran away when I was 15 and was kidnapped and raped.

I have been in inpatient hospitals/residentials for majority of the past 4 years. Ive had multiple suicide attempts, with the most recent one being I jumped off a freeway overpass into a freeway. I can no longer run or play sports because of that or walk for more then 20 minutes without being in pain. I have been self harming since I was 15, but the frequency has gone down a lot from daily to none in over 100 days.

I have been on about 20 or so different medications, and none of them in my opinion helped me to feel better. I often feel emotionally numb and detached and I rarely ever feel happy. I have periods of time where I am at my baseline (which is sad) to extremely hopeless and suicidal. These last sometimes only an hour or so to a couple weeks. I often restrict and purge to try to control my body weight, but I have noticed that the more controlled I feel that less I eat. I am very shy and it is hard for me to talk to people that I dont know at all because I overthink everything that I am doing and dont feel like I am good enough. Relationships are very scary because I am not used to trusting anyone or expecting anyone to stay. I always expect people to hurt me because that is what has always happened in the past. I am very jumpy and often have nightmares about my childhood.

I thought that I was only depressed because of my situation at home, but when I was removed from my parents home, I still had the same symptoms. When I started college, I still felt the same way after 2 years straight of being in residentials and hospitals. I had tried many medications and had a lot of therapy. Since I still felt the same in college, I got truly hopeless and had a serious suicide attempt. I had therapy sessions during those 2 years and after my attempt last year I spent almost another year in treatment. Nothing has really helped. And this 4 month gap is almost the longest I have gone without being hospitalized for the past 4 years.

Mainstream ways of treating depression and my other diagnosis is medication and therapy. Neither of those has helped me. I still feel suicidal and numb and sad all the time. I am just wondering if there is anything that could possibly help me. Are there any other treatments that could help? I have heard of TMS and ECT for depression and EMDR for ptsd, but I haven't tried that yet due to the cost. I really just want to get better and I want to live. I dont want to end my dying due to myself. I want to get better and make a better life for myself despite what happened to me, but I truly don't know how anymore.

Does anybody have any suggestions?",2,1,2025-11-07T03:15:43+00:00,https://reddit.com/r/depression/comments/1oqjjc0/does_depression_ever_really_get_better_what_kind/,Negative

I recently got stitches from cutting myself on my arm, which has just made my family more concerned about me.
The ironic thing is that despite how much I just want to sleep and never wake up I'm absolutely petrified of death and I just can't bring myself to try and commit suicide again like I did over a year ago.

Is it normal to experience relapses?

The symptoms are usually worse before my period.
Sometimes I feel full of energy and motivation, and other times I feel completely drained.

I struggle to even take a shower, I ignore house chores, I have zero energy, I lose interest in the things I love, and I stop going to the gym.

For half of my life I've had this heavy, aching weight inside of my chest. I've been a looming mist in other people's lives, filling the empty air with half-hearted plans and unkept promises. 

I'm in tens of thousands in debt from student loans and no degree to show for it. I've dropped out/taken leaves on and off since finishing my first semester of college, all for mental health reasons: eating disorder, alcoholism. Upon my most recent return (after a 5 year hiatus) I was really determined to finally finish what I started. This year felt like *the one*. I finally left an abusive 4-year relationship, I reassessed my priorities, and I started doing what's best for me. Then, after my first week of classes I was drugged, kidnapped, and raped by my coworker who is twice my age. Boom. Back to square one, again. Now I am out of a job and on another leave from school, waiting for a break in my case because my rapist is nowhere to be found. What the fuck do I do? I can't cope anymore. 

I just can't to do it. I don't want to keep trying, the more I try the more I feel myself digging deeper into a hole of debt and doubt for nothing. I feel like a sham and a waste. I see my older sister with her master's degree and 6-figure job, I see my cousin in his microbiology PhD program, I see all my college friends with their degrees, newer friends with established jobs, and it all hurts that I can't be that. I'm lost. I'm indecisive. I'm incapable. I've job hopped around 8 jobs in the past 5 years, I can't settle and I can't just be content. I never finish what I start. I'm stuck in this rut, the same rut I've been in since before I can even remember. I don't trust myself to pick a path that is right for me anymore. I keep hitting walls instead of finding a door and I want to give up trying so I can at least get used to the disappointment. 

This is my daily spiral. Today, it is especially overwhelming.

reddit,depression,1oqi1fg,jsgsbsvyasb,f911db0d3e5b33dc,How likely is it that I'm experiencing depression?,"So I'm a 15 year old girl in Texas. Since fifth grade I've always struggled with procrastination and since pretty much forever have been hypersensitivity and social anxiety. Somehow, this feels different, like a heavier problem. Lately I've been slacking on self-care, chores, schoolwork, and hobbies. I only ever do them if someone reminds me or helps me. I feel horrible about it, so I know it's not that I'm lazy. I play on my phone a lot at night, but even that hasn't ever made me this tired. Obviously I've struggled with communicating per social anxiety symptoms, but now I shut down at every perceived rejection and disappointment. Today my mom promised me sushi for dinner. A few hours ago, she said she was too tired and I literally felt the energy leave my body. I haven't been wanting to eat anything, I just have to so I do it, so when she said she was too tired to get it, it just felt like the one time I wanted something, I couldn't have it. Then I snapped at my younger brother for walking into my room, only to immediately switch back to being tired when he asked if I wanted to go to the convenience store with him because mom won't let him go alone. Now I just feel tired.

So reddit, what do you think based on this snippet of how the past few months has been going?",2,4,2025-11-07T02:04:17+00:00,https://reddit.com/r/depression/comments/1oqi1fg/how_likely_is_it_that_im_experiencing_depression/,Negative

Working with my therapist to help me reframe something I find unacceptable about myself, and it made me think. There are so many people who are wonderful, just, as is.

Long after those people have moved on, we find ourselves still stuck under that thumb, except now it’s our own thumb holding ourselves down. 
My therapist asked what I wished I could replace those feelings with and I finally remembered Tyrion Lannister, advising Jon Snow to own the thing he feels badly about, so it could never be used against him.

reddit,depression,1oqhj2k,Affectionate_Tip_108,9047550035e8417c,Why wont it end.,"Hey, I will introduce myself very quickly.

I’m 18 going on 19. I finally got to uni (which is a thing that I never thought I would achieve in my life). I never thought that I would get to live this long. I reached places that I never thought I would. I grew up, broke and in ghetto places. While growing up, I never thought that I would get to great places. I always thought that I would end up as a drug dealer or something (like a lotta ppl i’ve seen).

This year was one of my worst. I almost ended it all, but I didn’t. It was one of the most exhausting ones ever but I tried to stay alive. They put me on meds (didn’t work btw), I almost got sent to a psych ward, but I managed to finish high school and graduate. Now I don’t regret any of this, but this deep sinking hole, this hollow feeling in my chest will never. fucking. go.

I have been feeling like this for five years now it gets worse and worse. I stopped taking meds because I fucking hate them and since I moved cities, I don’t have a therapist or anything. But honestly, I don’t even see the problem with that since when I had all of that, nothing changed.

Please, I’m tired of feeling like that, I genuinely do not have my own will to live. I don’t even live for myself no more, all that I do is not even for myself. I feel like I will never get better and that I’ll always come back to this no matter how far I’ll get.

I don’t even think that living is fun no more. I have those phases where I think that I’m doing good, and all of a sudden it comes back.

I really hate it.

reddit,depression,1oqg854,Strange_Hero,782a6c8f9257ac9c,"Want to help others, but I can't help myself","TW: Self-harm, sewerslide  
  
When I was starting high school, I realized both of my parents were diagnosed with schizophrenia--my mother was also epileptic and my dad's bipolar--and that explained a lot of what I experienced. Before I graduated I was homeless for about a month during my Freshman year, my mother told me she wanted to take her own life/wanted to die and then succeeded several months into my Sophomore year, and my father was in and out of prison. With everything I experienced I decided I wanted to help people like myself who were dealt a bad hand in life.

And then, I became depressed. Motivation was, all of a sudden, difficult to find.

Right around when COVID lockdown happened I was in my Sophomore/Junior year of college working towards an education degree. The way I saw it at the time, I could help students in high school like myself once I had my education credentials. However, my part-time job at the time put a spotlight on a lot of the hardships people were going through. I saw my manager fall down and cry behind the register, overwhelmed by rude customers and their rising medical costs. My coworkers and I joked about how we'd never afford houses nearly every day. My friends who started teaching explained how broken the system had become, sharing horror stories about students who were illiterate in the 8th grade. Everyone spoke about their declining mental health, and people I knew who stayed silent were clearly suffering in their own way. I decided if I wanted to help people, I had to focus on fundamental issues, and I shifted my focus over to social work or counseling. 

I took a step in that direction earlier this year, volunteering for an overseas aid program. A combination of US politics I don't want to get into, and the realization that I wasn't actually helping anyone in that program (I saw people living in poverty like you wouldn't believe, but the program's primary aim was to teach people about how great America is... I stopped believing America was great years before that) led to me calling our medical team for help. I shared that I was feeling very depressed, was thinking about harming myself, and needed a way to relieve my stress. They flew me home the next day.

When I arrived back in town, I got a call from family I was staying with, they told me I couldn't stay there anymore. Ended up on a friend's couch while he was in the hospital, he came home that night and explained that he now has a hospital bill he couldn't afford. Eventually I ended up living with my Dad in his one bedroom apartment after years of trying to keep away from him. My twisted fate landed me back with my abuser, essentially.

So now I'm here trying to get back on my feet. I wake up every day, upset that I woke up, and I lay in bed every night hoping to feel better tomorrow. I think about game ending myself often, even at my part-time job, and whenever I try and make plans for the future I realize how bleak everything is. For example, a recent political move made it so my college tuition is now unaffordable with federal loans, I'm financially unable to work towards my counseling degree thanks to a government decision. One year ago, I could afford it. Now? That option is next to impossible, but I'm trying. I don't qualify for Social Work anymore due to a string of bad luck (my 'mentor' who was my #1 recommender has been publicly disgraced and is being investigated for fraud) and stricter requirements, not that Social Work is a desirable career path given the state of the world right now.

But I can't think of anything else I'd want to do, I want nothing more than to help people, but it feels like I can't find a way to do it and whenever I'm focusing on myself I feel miserable. However, I don't have a lot of options anymore. Most of my family quite literally sees me as a burden, hates my father because of his illness, or hates being around me because they feel guilt over what happened with my mom. Yet, I need help. 

I don't know where I can reach out for help at this point. I'm young (in my mid-late 20s) and I have a bachelors degree, but I feel so miserable it's difficult holding a job. When driving to my previous job, I daydreamed about turning into oncoming traffic. But when I'm at work helping someone, I feel great and fulfilled. It's just that right now all of my job prospects are awful, and even though I am motivated to attend college... it's too expensive!

Thanks for reading, and if anyone knows of any resources I can look into for free/reduced counseling or therapy, that'd really help me a lot. It won't solve everything, but it'd at least give me a bit of support while I work on figuring out how I can move forward instead of being stuck.",2,0,2025-11-07T00:41:17+00:00,https://reddit.com/r/depression/comments/1oqg854/want_to_help_others_but_i_cant_help_myself/,Negative

I can’t speak to my partner. I can’t tell her anything anymore. She’s got some stuff going on and I tried to open up to her recently and got ignored, so that’s completely put me off. I feel embarrassed about it now.

reddit,depression,1oqecr1,AsleepSense3135,2e7fff49201ea045,I think I’ve reached the point where pain just feels normal now,"I’m a 31-year-old guy living abroad, and I just needed to share this somewhere, because keeping it all inside is slowly crushing me.

Earlier this year, I went through a breakup that completely shattered me. I begged and pleaded for her to stay, but she walked away like I never mattered. What destroyed me most was how quickly she moved on within two weeks she had already replaced me, sharing her “new life” online, seeking validation from strangers, acting like the last few years meant nothing.

While she was doing that, my world was falling apart. My mom had a stroke, my dad had an accident that left him struggling to walk, and my sister was diagnosed with leukemia. I lost her in July. I felt like life was punishing me for something I didn’t even do.

And yet through all that, I still tried to be the good guy helping my family financially, keeping my job together, and forcing a smile just to survive another day. But deep down, I’ve felt this mix of heartbreak, betrayal, and emptiness that I can’t even put into words.

I’m not looking for pity. I just needed to be honest for once. It hurts when someone you loved so deeply throws you away like you never existed and then you have to somehow keep living, working, and pretending you’re okay while they’re out there acting like nothing ever happened.

People say karma comes back, or that everything happens for a reason. But I’m not sure anymore. I used to believe in love, and I used to believe in fairness but now I’m not sure what to believe in at all.

If anyone’s ever had their heart broken that deeply  when it felt like your entire identity collapsed  how did you rebuild? How did you start believing again? Because right now, I’m just existing .",2,1,2025-11-06T23:21:22+00:00,https://reddit.com/r/depression/comments/1oqecr1/i_think_ive_reached_the_point_where_pain_just/,Negative

Was feeling really down all the time so went and got checked out midway through the relationship and turns out I was depressed, got prescribed medication which helped at first but when it started working less my (now ex) said that my reactions to her being horrible to me were my problem and I should “get a higher strength”

I thought things would get better post relationship but they haven’t, I feel like I’m living the same life day in day out, I don’t have any friends, I barely have anyone speak to me outside of work and most nights I lie alone in darkness, I’ve tried reaching out to friends from my past but normally get left on read with no reply

Is there any suggestions that can help me?

reddit,depression,1oqaqoy,Original_Craft4837,5817b203d9d0e612,Living as an atheist in a muslim country,"M22 here. I'm living in a muslim country, born&raised, and year ago I came to a conclusion that there is no sky daddy who is constantly keeping an eye on us. But the thing is I can't tell or even hint about my apostasy to anyone in this country, because of blasphemy laws which mandate life or death sentence. Although apostasy itself is not a crime but it comes under the broader definition of blasphemy laws. But before I get to the legal prosecution/persecution, if people around me got a whiff of me being an apostate, i will face ostracization from my family, potential mob lynching me to death because i will be a walking ticket to heaven for these people.

I was introverted and asocial even before my apostasy, but now it's weighing upon me, I don't have anyone to talk to, express emotions and I crave intimacy. I'm certain there are other atheists living here as well but no one in their right mind would openly admit of being an apostate due to obvious reasons mentioned earlier. Finding such a partner in this country is akin to finding a needle in an ocean. I don't have any social life. I interact with my peers during class hours but once classes end, I quickly head towards home without interacting with anyone in university premises.

I live alone in my family owned house in another city, almost wrapping my bachelors within few months. Then there is another thing, arranged marriages in this country, my parents will insist that I get married after completion of my studies but I can't marry a muslim woman, it will be a disaster for me and also intellectual dishonesty on my behalf.

I wish I could find a likeminded partner in this fucked up South Asian country. Living as an atheist in a muslim country is like a self imposed mental exile. I'm depressed and sometimes I get suicidal ideation, but i quickly do something else to avoid such thoughts. But in all seriousness, what is the point of living? The human need for closure, attachement, a partner, socializing is the greatest weakness. 

I have planned an escape plan from this country and that's the only thing keeping me alive. But according to that plan, I'm stuck here till 2028 and I can't take it anymore, its hard. I dont know what i'm gonna do if that fails.",3,4,2025-11-06T20:58:53+00:00,https://reddit.com/r/depression/comments/1oqaqoy/living_as_an_atheist_in_a_muslim_country/,Negative

I'm 20 years old and just completely lost in life, Work a job I don't like and have an absurd amount of pressure to get a career but I'm a massive overthinker so I'm incredibly cautious to go after a career because I'm afraid ill be in the middle of a career that I'll hate, none of the career paths that are presented to me are interesting to me. I have NO CLUE what to do career wise but yet everyone else seems to know what career they've wanted to do since they were a kid- I always ask myself ""Why not me"" why do people get to know what they want to do in life but not me? My interests lie with Filmmaking and Music but I have zero experience with both and is just unrealistic to pursue - I live in New Zealand too so it makes it even more unrealistic. Also I feel like I am not Seen or Heard or Understood in the slightest and I have no idea why. I find it so immensely hard to connect with anyone because I feel like I'm always on a different wavelength to literally everyone. I'm not sad, it's the non-existence of happiness in my life that is really what is weighing me down, I feel nothing. I honestly feel like I was born in the wrong body at the wrong time and place, I feel like I could belong and have a great life is circumstances were just different-just not where I am now. What makes it so much harder is that I have family and friends that love me so much and I had a loving upbringing which makes it harder because It's almost like I feel guilty for feeling this way because others have had it alot worse

""They say that S*****e is a selfish act, and i don't necessarily disagree but in my eyes it is selfish to keep living for the sole purpose of the happiness of other people"" People want you to keep living but it's almost like they don't care if you hate doing so as long as you're alive

Is there any point in continuing on?

It has been the same thing everyday for 3 weeks. I wake up, maybe between 11-14:00 usually already filled with anxiety for either no reason, or because of a bad ptsd dream. I usually throw up within the first hour of being awake, so its all stomach bile and just makes my appetite diminish even more. I have to immediately start distracting my self from my thoughts because all I can hear are negative doubts about my future and about how fucked my whole situation is.

I stay in bed or on the couch all day, and then at night my anxiety gets 10 times worse. Then I have to find any means to distract myself until I am physically unable to keep myself awake, and fall asleep and repeat.

reddit,Anxiety,1oqitte,WillowKings,7406cf8676876905,Health anxiety ruining my relationships,"I’m ruining all my relationships because of health anxiety and medical trauma

This isn’t venting I just genuinely don’t know what to do here and need advice. I’ve had health anxiety since I turned 18- I worked really hard on erp therapy (exposure and tolerance building) got to a really great place and was doing amazing. Then I had something really rare and devastating happen to me (sertonin syndrome) that wound up with a longer ICU stay, then following that another hospitalization regarding another long health fear I had for years not even a month after the icu stay.

This shattered my sense of safety- especially as the initial icu stay took me advocating for myself at 3 hospitals before they actually tested me for sertonin syndrome and then me being rushed into critical care because it was so bad and my care had been so delayed from them not believing me because I have anxiety. 

My trust in the medical system kinda broke, my trust in my health shattered, and all my exposure work and practice just feels like was stripped away from me. Yet at the same time the only time I feel safe is at a hospital because I know they will do their best to not let me die. 

Since then- it’s been about a month and my health anxiety is the worst it has ever been, alongside trauma. I’m working with my therapist on the trauma and retrying exposure but I never feel safe anymore. 

It’s ruining my relationship with my mother and father because I’m always crying and wanting to rush to the ER and be tested over things. And they keep saying you’re fine, you’re fine and then yelling at me that I can’t keep doing this, that they’re exhausted running me around 24/7 and tired of my constant panic. They just keep saying well your results two weeks ago said you were fine, and then I say but I don’t feel fine, I’m not ok right now because I was supposed to be fine and just anxious and then I was in the icu and then a month later back in the hospital undergoing more things. 

I get why they’re tired of it and I get from their perspective- that this is useless and expensive and a waste of time. That i should feel calm and relieved, but my entire world has been shaken from the ground up again. 

I worked so so hard to get to a point of confidence and trust in my body and it feels like it was stolen from me. I want to feel safe again and find grounding- I look over my old therapy notes and use my coping techniques and try exposure but my nerves are a frayed wire and the nightmares of my icu stay and subsequent rush to the hospital for another emergency wake me up at night crying. 

My mom even told me tonight “I don’t even trust what you tell us your feeling physically anymore to know if you need an ER. Because last time you were in soooo much pain and we took you and you were fine and now you’re claiming it’s happening again. How am I suppose to trust what you’re saying when you’ve been fine?” 

I don’t want to keep going to the ER and I hate I’m ruining my relationship with my parents. I hate that they don’t even believe when I try to tell them I don’t feel good- I’m scared they’ll never be able to know if something is actually wrong now and get me help god forbid another emergency situation happens- because I had to BEG to go the hospital when I got rushed to the ICU. I’m trying to explain I don’t like this and that I’m trying to recover but it’s only been a month and that I just want comfort from them- not reassurance, but to just hold me or something because I’m scared.

reddit,Anxiety,1oqlvfb,Throwaway372646,d5a02f627b21eb1c,Currently dealing with bad anxiety,"Hello all,

This is my first post in this subreddit. I have always been an anxious person, but I would say that my anxiety has gotten worse over this past year. Right now, I feel like I can’t breathe and have a heavy feeling in my chest.

Generally, my anxiety can be caused by very random things, like a weird noise I hear while driving or getting fired from my job. Right now, I am having a panic attack because I keep imagining getting fired from my job. For some more context, my job is very safety oriented, and I would say that I’m good at following the safety rules. However, I sometimes second guess myself. Today, I used the electric pallet jack to move a pallet from the warehouse to my department of the store. I lowered the forks, shut the EPJ off, and took the keys out of the ignition. I cannot recall whether or not I put on the emergency break. I know I did when I used the EPJ earlier, but I don’t remember for the second time.

I was initially going to take the EPJ back to the warehouse before I clocked out for my shift. However, since I didn’t have time, I handed the keys to the manager and told him that the EPJ was still on the floor. He told me that he would have someone move it along with the pallet. However, my anxiety is making me feel like I did something wrong.

reddit,Anxiety,1oqgdn6,wewereinfinite12,b306602957f589eb,I'm worried lexapro is making me a worse student,"For context, I have probably had anxiety for a long time, but last year was my first year in grad school and it become too much, leading to frequent panic attacks, insomnia, etc. I talked to my doctor and got started on Lexapro 10 mg, which has decreased my academic anxiety a ton! I was happy with that but asked my doctor about increasing my dosage because I noticed that I still had quite a bit of social and medical anxiety, so I got moved up to 20 mg. I'm still in the transition period before the 20 mg is probably actually effective.

  
Recently, and even before the dose increase, I have noticed that I have been far less motivated to study, which is essential in my program. I have noticed that I have been performing far worse on exams, and I am worried it is due to the anxiety meds. Previously, as the exams approached, my anxiety would increase so that I was far more motivated to study. By the time it was the day before the exam, I would study all day and be incredibly focused. This helped me do very well on exams. Now, however, I find that I barely start studying before the exams and I give up on studying sooner. I now have the mindset of ""grades don't matter."" Originally, I was really happy about this attitude change because I was the type of person who felt I needed to get an A on every assessment, but now I am worried it is going too far in the opposite direction.

  
I was wondering if anybody had any advice about this. Currently, I have a desire to stop my meds so I can do better in school again, but then I know this will likely bring about the return of my anxiety attacks and immense stress associated with academic success. I'm just having a difficult time deciding how to find a balance between the good and bad anxiety. (I do plan on discussing this with my doctor at an upcoming appointment, but was hoping for advice from anybody who has been in a similar situation or has any thoughts.)

  
TLDR - after starting anxiety meds, I worry I'm a worse student because anxiety was the main thing that made me study enough to do well in school",7,4,2025-11-07T00:48:07+00:00,https://reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/1oqgdn6/im_worried_lexapro_is_making_me_a_worse_student/,Negative

Worst or second worst I’ve ever had, hard to compare. About six weeks ago I increased two of my meds (Paxil from 20mg to 30mg and Klonopin from 0.5mg to 0.75mg — both these higher doses are levels that I was at a bit more than a year ago, before I started doing worse and went down a bit on both meds).

I have started having these really strange experiences. It started happening around when I increased my meds — maybe like a week later, it’s hard for me to remember the exact timeline. It’s really difficult for me to explain. It’s kind of like category confusion. It’s like I will think that I should say no to something but say yes instead, or I will think one thing is true and say the opposite. Just now I had a long conversation with my sibling where we were both really emotionally, exhausted, and they heard me saying that I didn’t want them to come to an event that I am doing tomorrow, but I’m pretty sure that I was saying that I did want them to come. It’s things like that. It seems to also be something that is pretty consistently happening when I’m particularly tired. And in the last few weeks, my depression has been less bad than it was, but this strange confusion has still been happening a lot.

I have one bottle of .5mg that’s from 2022 and one bottle from 2024. 

It starts with tingling/tickling sensation down both arms and the absolute worst panic attacks of my entire life. I went to the ER for two nights. No stroke. MRI of brain and spine mostly fine.

My primary doubled my lexapro to 20mg and I’m starting tonight. She also prescribed 1mg extended release Xanax that I can’t pick up until tomorrow. Tonight has been the absolute worst panic of my life. I took .5 and then .25 and then another .25mg of my 2024 Xanax and still nothing. Same tickling feels down my arms, adrenaline pumping.

reddit,Anxiety,1oqpje4,Banaanisade,2b71d51dc3db0a15,Travelling makes me sick.,"At the very back end of my wits, about to be out of them entirely right now.

I've always reacted to everything with my stomach. When I started going to online meetups as a kid, around 13, I'd always be so sick I couldn't eat. Just before then I'd travelled for the first time, just a night in a ship and then to a beach side location, nowhere far - we thought I got seasick, but it wasn't that. For years it was better, my mum loves dragging me on adventures with her so I travelled a lot and from those times I have a lot of memories eating at restaurants in Italy, for example, and just not being haunted by this issue.

But then I didn't travel much for a few years, and my last experiences of it were conventions, where I would always be so nauseous I couldn't eat more than a triangle sandwich and a milkshake from whatever kiosks were available at the airports they were hosted in or nearby. And then no travel. And then I finally went to London again with my mother - and I got so incredibly sick we thought it was food poisoning. After that? I actually got sick for real with a three week bronchitis, and it's also extremely typical for me to get very sick with a cold or the like in general just after travel, typically on the last day.

I'm in London again, and I quickly realised it wasn't food poisoning, because I'm just as sick now as I was then and I didn't even eat anything before my flight, just had two medium-sized pumpkin spice lattes, one caffeinated and one not, at the airport before my flight. Came here for a theatre show so I'm flying out again today and after three days of struggling to put anything in my body, I'm just praying it ends when I get home. And I'm probably going to get a fever again then, because after all this hyperstress from nothing, my immune system WILL crash again. I'm already getting a minor infection in a surgery wound from two weeks ago that I'm really hoping will not be the crash that I'm going to have, because antibiotics are just about the last thing I want to be dealing with after this.

I'm autistic and I think the routine interruption plays a large role in this - last time, I was sick for a week beforehand, couldn't sleep and couldn't eat, even before the travel started. But NOT like I was sick when I was actually there. Now I was distressed and unable to calm down for about a day and a half, which is vastly better, but clearly not enough.

Blessedly I took my sedatives with me and after reading online for a while, took a half yesterday morning though I wasn't sure it'd help since I don't necessarily feel very anxious mentally.... and lo and behold, I could actually eat something, at least until the theatre. After that I felt vaguely queasy again and didn't dare to eat anything more than the usual dinner I've gotten used to here, which is a single finger-length chicken skewer from Tesco and some mineral water.

I'm about to amputate my entire central nervous system and my stomach both. I love travel more than most things in the world but all I get to do is worry about whether I'm going to throw up or have other very urgent business with the nearest toilet to deal with. Met a friend for an afternoon here and we spent a nice one hour in a tube station toilet because I dared to eat a couple chili cheese bites from the Burger King while my friend and my partner were having burgers.

To top this? I have severe emetophobia, so nausea locks me down like nothing else. As is typical for anxiety, I don't feel like I can control this and I don't know what to do about it. Before this year I'd also get massive panic attacks and nausea at the movies, but I conditioned myself away from them by going a ton more alone so after about 11 visits I actually started feeling safe - but travel is entirely too expensive to get used to. And maybe it won't be a problem for much because I can barely save any money to begin with so I don't really have the funds to travel - but I can't just... stop doing something that is so enriching and incredible in my life because I have an idiot turd for a brain.

I'm so tired of living with anxiety. If it isn't this, it's something about my health, and I can think of nothing else. It was worse before but no medication has ever really helped with it, aside from sedatives; long-term medications don't really seem to work for me (possibly because I have CPTSD), and I've been off sertraline for a year now and I'm doing great and I'm definitely not going to get back on it when it clearly didn't help before either (last year's ""food poisoning"" was entirely medicated). But I don't want to spend my time sedated 24/7 either. Why, WHY can't I have some symptom I can live with instead?

ETA: and eating definitely does not improve the situation. I can be just about fine as long as I'm starving, but then I think hey I'm okay, have a bite of anything, and it's hell again for six hours from there. Doesn't matter if it's the blandest bite or something I actually enjoy, it makes my brain think I must dump that nonsense RIGHT.

I’m supposed to start taking this daily, at 40mg, and if tonight is anything to go on, I am really optimistic that I may have found a medication breakthrough.

For anyone not familiar, Propranolol is a heart/migraine/blood pressure medication that is used off-label for anxiety. From what I understand, it essentially blocks your body’s ability to be in fight or flight. Which at this point in life, I feel like I am constantly trapped in.

I’ll likely make more updates as I get used to it more and get to test it in my day to day life.

Thanks everyone for commenting! I’m glad to see this helps so many people! 

Unfortunately today I had to call into work. Last night I became quite nauseous about 6 hours after use and found myself hanging out in the bathroom on and off throughout the night. No vomiting, thankfully, but it was an unpleasant experience. I don’t know why it took so long to have this side effect, but even now this morning, over 12 hours later, i’m feeling a little queasy.

I also began experiencing what felt like post-nasal drip, which slightly restricted my airway and made it harder to fall asleep.

Once I was asleep, I thankfully didn’t wake up at all until my alarm. 

I’m going to try taking 10mg this morning and see if that improves things at all because those 6 hours yesterday before side effects were absolute bliss.

I’m writing here because I’ve been really struggling with a superstition related to Vastu and studying. I work from home, and for the past year, I’ve been unable to study properly because I keep worrying about which direction I’m facing.

Whenever I try to sit and study, my mind starts telling me things like “this is the right direction” or “this is the wrong direction.” I’ve read that facing certain directions (like south) is inauspicious, and that thought got stuck in my mind. Now, even when I try to focus, my subconscious keeps associating directions with good or bad luck.

The strange part is that I actually feel most comfortable and pleasant facing south — that’s where my window is, and I get good light and air. But because of what I read and what my family and surroundings believe, I feel anxious and guilty sitting that way.

I know this might sound irrational, but it’s affecting my ability to study and concentrate. I can’t change my living space for at least another year, so I want to find a way to deal with this mentally and emotionally.

Are these Vastu directions really something to worry about, or is this more of a psychological thing I need to work through? Has anyone else dealt with similar beliefs affecting their focus or peace of mind?

Any advice or guidance would mean a lot. Thank you for reading. 🙏",1,2,2025-11-07T07:54:10+00:00,https://reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/1oqoh3o/struggling_with_vastu_superstitions_about_study/,Negative

I wanted to share something I've been experiencing for a long time and see if other people can relate.

I consider myself very emotionally sensitive: I feel everything very intensely — the emotions of others, my own emotions, and even the most mundane social situations. It sometimes manifests itself in physical reactions that I can't control: I blush easily, I cry when I'm afraid or when I'm very emotional, I get chills, and I can even start yawning to regulate my body.

When I'm really overwhelmed, I often have mental fog, a sort of mild dissociation: I stare at one point, I no longer speak, I feel empty and “disconnected”. It’s psychologically exhausting, and even though it allows me to be very patient, it tires me out a lot. I also sometimes have very realistic nightmares that leave me feeling intensely afraid when I wake up.

I realize that I often hide my emotions behind a shell to appear strong and mature, but inside I experience everything very intensely. And I think that contributes to my mental fatigue.

I wanted to know if some people here feel the same way: intense hypersensitivity, uncontrollable physical reactions, mental fatigue or fog, mild dissociation, or fear of being “too much” for others?
I would like to exchange experiences and perhaps tips to better manage all this on a daily basis, because sometimes it can really be difficult.

He used dating apps, second phones, hidden chat rooms, that sort of thing, and it has caused me great anxiety about electronics and social media, including my own. 

I’d gotten a lot better until last year, when my stepmom, whom I’m close with, discovered my dad’s cheating again (there had been a decade-long lull, but he got caught in a blackmail scam.) Everything blew up, and it reignited everything I’d worked hard on.

Now, my partner is a bit of an iPad kid, and of course he has friends, so he games, watches videos, scrolls social media, etc etc. Sometimes I’ll catch something that, in normal circumstances, should be innocuous, but flares horrible feelings of betrayal and fear in me. Today, it was me getting on his PC (since I don’t have my own) and catching the end of a Discord chat when I went to close it out. It was already open, and I hate that my brain went to read any of it when I was closing the window. It was with a couple work friends (I think?) where one of them references him having a “Discord kitten”.

I know guys have stupid conversations like that, and it probably didn’t mean anything, but immediately I thought of my mom finding all the chat logs with all those women. I don’t use Discord. I don’t even want to check. I don’t want to confront him, because he didn’t even say anything and he can’t control what other people say *just in case* I happen to read it. I get so sick to my stomach and I feel like the world is caving in every single time, and I hate that I keep bringing these silly little questions up to him. I want him to feel comfortable and I need him to know that I absolutely do trust him! Sometimes, the stars align in the absolute worst way and I’m just a little kid again, watching my mom’s life fall apart at at the kitchen counter on a school night.",1,0,2025-11-07T06:58:15+00:00,https://reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/1oqnlsp/dealing_with_a_little_trigger_in_my_own/,Negative
reddit,Anxiety,1oqnifm,Baevacado,2ce3a12eaaa1a66b,Heart Attack Anxiety,"Hello everyone! For the last several months, the overbearing anxiety of having a heart attack has totally destroyed me. I have had multiple EKGs, loads of bloodwork, a 7 day holter monitor, CT scans, an ultrasound, and everything always comes back the same: happy, healthy heart. I’m only 23yrs so the risk is already slim to none in the first place. Yet, every single night, I am in a constant battle with HA symptoms and hours of struggle to keep calm. 
This all started about six months ago with a very sudden and terrifying trip to the ER. To keep things short, I’d been in the middle of watching a movie (Rango!) before an abrupt pain spread through my entire chest and made it nearly impossible to breathe. My entire body went uncontrollably rigid and tensed every muscle, leaving me in unbearable pain and unable to move. My husband had to carry me to my car. When I got into the Er my heart rate was at 207bpm and my blood pressure was sitting at 159/101. When it was over the doctor let me know it was just a panic attack. What? I was awfully confused. I’ve dealt with GAD and a panic disorder ever since I was a child, and this out of the blue attack was absolutely nothing like the panic attacks and episodes of anxiety I’d ever faced before. But there was nothing I could do about it, just received soothing meds and was sent home not even an hour later.
That’s when everything went downhill. The next night, just lying in bed, I jolted upright because of a painful and slow palpitation. Then the pain started up instantly, shot down my left arm, and I got super nauseous. It was like the previous night all over again, minus the involuntary muscle pain/tensing. I returned to the ER and they did another EKG with some bloodwork. Both came back fine! A young and healthy heart. I was discharged and once again diagnosed with a panic attack.
I drove myself insane for weeks. I couldn’t count on both hands how many times I’d went to the ER over the same exact symptoms happening every single night, but what I can tell you is they’ve performed every test under the sun that’s confirmed there is nothing wrong with my heart. Not even my lungs. Gallbladder and liver are healthy too. But even with undeniable medical proof I couldn’t be convinced that there wasn’t some mysterious hidden issue going on with me, and I got stuck in a cycle of a lot of pain because of that fear. I started to avoid things that spiked my heart rate such as climbing stairs, eating large meals, and even laughing!! I let my fear consume me and it was the worst decision I ever made.
After getting put on Metoprolol to combat what my doctor said to be anxiety induced palpitations and chest pain, I realized I’m way too young to be stressing so severely. I felt as if I continued living like this then my body would eventually respond with making me sick. I packed my things and took a long stay at my parents house. For starters, they live in the middle of nowhere with the nearest hospital being over an hour away which took away my temptation to need to be in the ER 24/7. Secondly, being in a home with family made me feel less anxious and staying in my childhood bedroom helped me feel at ease. Whenever the symptoms would start up, I’d grit my teeth and force myself to tough it out. I didn’t die, of course, and I hadn’t died all the other times. I used that encouragement to help me push through these nights and retrain my brain to understand that everything is alright. The pain is physical but it is survivable in the end.
I kept that mindset up to this very moment. I sit through the symptoms and remind myself I’ve done this just about a hundred times before and ALWAYS come out fine. I still wonder why this all happened to me on one random night without any prior history of something similar, but I don’t want to dwell on that thought and convince myself I’m secretly dying all over again. Whenever these episodes start up I still get those nagging fears of “It’s definitely a heart attack this time,” much like right now as I write this post. But it’s so odd to also be aware that I’m fine. I thought I would have gotten over this hurdle by now and I’m starting to get exhausted by the amount of energy it takes to handle this process, especially considering it’s been almost a year of it happening to me every night. I’ve made it this far and I’m proud but I’m so tired. I want just one night without physical pain, I wanna live my life again when I didn’t have to convince myself every little bodily ache wasn’t a sign of illness or incoming death.

I’m a young guy (20s). Fit. Active. I’m in the gym 5 days a week. I do MMA. Have great friends. Surrounded by family. Lots of hobbies. I’m thankful for the blessings in my life. The last few months I’ve been dealing with anxiety. It’s been a stressful year indeed. Lost my grandma. Mom went through cancer (but beat it!). Got in a car accident. Broke up with my fiancé. But still did it with a smile on my face. The anxiety started creeping up on me slowly. 

I was so scared I got my heart checked multiple times. Had 3 EKG’s. Blood work. Chest X-Ray (was dealing with an MMA related injury). Made two trips to the ER. Met with my doctor. Everything came back normal. A few weeks back I had a terrible anxiety attack. I’m a caffeine addict. That day, I must’ve had about 4 servings of caffeine. I’m also a Zyn user. And I must’ve taken way too many that day. It was a full blown anxiety attack. I was laying on my floor curled up in a ball. Heart racing. This ball of anxiety in my stomach. I was EXHAUSTED after that. Since then, the anxiety has been off and on. It creeps up a little but nothing crazy. I’ve cut back on the caffeine and have limited the Zyns (trying to quit for good). Today, I had another anxiety attack. Came home from work. Showered. Ate dinner. It started creeping back up on me. I was laying on the couch watching football and decided to Google my symptoms which must have made it worse because…well my anxiety was through the roof. Heart racing, that pit in my stomach. I couldn’t explain it. 

I’m not sure why I’m here exactly. To vent. For support perhaps. I think ever since that day where I had a full blown attack from the caffeine, my mind has been hyper fixated on that. It’s constantly on my mind. Today, I had two cups of coffee. I’m not sure how big of a role coffee plays on anxiety. The combination of caffeine and nicotine definitely messes with me. 

That’s all I had to say really. I’m a little scared. But it’s nice knowing there’s others out there like me. I’m not too sure where this anxiety came from. I was never an anxious person.

reddit,Anxiety,1oql9j5,Acceptable-Wall2800,78564e8b7d3bc632,What is wrong with my brain,"I have had a major depressive episode for about the last three months. Worst or second worst I’ve ever had, hard to compare. About six weeks ago I increased two of my meds (Paxil from 20mg to 30mg and Klonopin from 0.5mg to 0.75mg — both these higher doses are levels that I was at a bit more than a year ago, before I started doing worse and went down a bit on both meds).

I have started having these really strange experiences. It started happening around when I increased my meds — maybe like a week later, it’s hard for me to remember the exact timeline. It’s really difficult for me to explain. It’s kind of like category confusion. It’s like I will think that I should say no to something but say yes instead, or I will think one thing is true and say the opposite. Just now I had a long conversation with my sibling where we were both really emotionally, exhausted, and they heard me saying that I didn’t want them to come to an event that I am doing tomorrow, but I’m pretty sure that I was saying that I did want them to come. It’s things like that. It seems to also be something that is pretty consistently happening when I’m particularly tired. And in the last few weeks, my depression has been less bad than it was, but this strange confusion has still been happening a lot.

I don’t understand what’s going on with my brain. I just read something about pseudodementia, and now I’m worried that that’s what this is.

In early 2024, I was prescribed Zoloft for postpartum anxiety/rage, and it seemed to work well for a little while, and I felt amazing. I’ve always had issues with anxiety, depression, and I’m almost positive I have ADHD. Eventually, I was overcome with fatigue, zero libido, and gained 30 pounds. A few months ago, my doctor offered to switch me to Wellbutrin. It totally improved all of the Zoloft side effects, and helped my brain feel more organized, however, the irritability is worse than it ever has been. I have no fuse at all, and it makes my anxiety and mental health even worse, because I feel like all I do is yell at my kids for every minor annoyance. We stopped the Wellbutrin, and that IS improving, but my anxiety is back to being bad (lots of fear about my kids/family getting hurt, sick, dying, becoming a widow, etc.). So my doctor offered for me to try Buspirone.

How have people’s experiences been? Especially if you’ve experienced similar side effects on Zoloft and Wellbutrin. I don’t want to be a zombie that does nothing but eat, but I also can’t be a rabid dog snapping at my kids all the time.

I got an email from my university today letting me know that a quick visual check of my dorm room will be done someday this week, between 10-4. I have nothing to hide, but I already feel on edge due to the constant threat of being walked in on. I also just hate being observed, and I fear I’m going to be judged for my room not being 100% neat and clean.

I feel like I’m being watched constantly.

The next couple days I was shaken and having pretty intense anxiety until it happened again on Tuesday. Since then I have just had crippling anxiety. Barely able to get out of bed, can’t eat, super focused on my heart rate. This has happened a few other times in my life for like a week at a time. Has anyone experienced this? I’m exhausted and scared. I feel like this will never end. I was feeling a bit better today and even made it to my front porch to sit in the sun but now i’m starting to feel it again and just had my second anxiety attack today. Which again is an improvement from yesterday but discouraging. I’ve also been taking benadryl to help calm me down which is helping a lot but is that hindering my healing?

I’ve been going through somethings in the last two years, that has elevated my anxiety and depression enough to where I had to start seeking professional help and medication. It’s been difficult.  

It sometimes get to the point where it becomes stressful to drive on drives that I’ve done plenty of times, the thought of returning to work is a constant addition to my stress ( I’ve been out of work for over a year for a work injury ).  Constantly worrying about how I’ll be paying rent at the end of the month and a never ending cycle of catching up on bills. 

I keep putting up this façade that everything will be ok, try to take things one day at time, worry less about the future and focus on the present, I can’t control what the future will hold but I can control the now.  But deep down inside my world is spinning, my heart feels like it wants to explode, my head is a vicious never ending of what if’s. 

I’ve never been good with grammar or writing so I hope this makes sense to anyone who finds this. I’m sure iam not the only one that feels like this.

So, I (30f) need some advice, or words of wisdom or encouragement or something please 😭 my anxiety has been SO bad lately.

Today (Thursday) I’m just so dizzy and spacey and I feel like I’m floating around. I’ve been reading and researching and found it could be fluid build up from the infection, or TMJ, which im pretty sure I have, or it could be anxiety. I did realize it got worse the more I dwelled on it. But man I can’t help myself but to. My anxiety has been so bad. Especially my health anxiety. Every time I feel off about something I start panicking so bad. I have seizures as well so I immediately start getting so nervous. I just wanted to know if this is a common feeling with anxiety? Or if it’s a fluid build up maybe? I just need someone to make me feel better so I don’t have a panic attack please. I’m in a really small town with little to no resources and I ride to the closest hospital (40 min away) so thats not an option unless it’s an actual emergency. Thank y’all very much.

i do have issues with my thyroid and have been off medication for over a year now…not intentionally, life just got busy. I have called recently to get seen again by my endocrinologist, but there wasn’t any available appointments until January, so it’s gonna be a while until I see her again.

But in the mean time, what is the best way to reduce my anxiety around these palpitations or any way to reduce them in general. This feeling really sucks. I’ve managed to keep myself from going into panic attacks but it’s super super scary. the thought of going into a panic attack also scares me, i hate the feeling of a panic attack as i feel completely out of control, out of body, and also like i am dying. 

i am at a very low point in my anxiety journey right now. i don’t know what else to do. i’ve tried breathing, distractions, but my brain keeps telling me i am one heart flutter away from dying. i just feel very alone right now. any help or advice would be appreciated.

i also just started a new job this week, im thinking that may be a cause of added stress feeding into my anxiety, which could be causing this feeling. ",1,3,2025-11-07T02:26:23+00:00,https://reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/1oqiia0/heart_palpitations_really_scaring_me/,Negative

Long story short I’ve been on and off zoloft basically my entire life. Zoloft helped a lot but I also felt kinda wack on it. Last year I got off my Zoloft, went thru the god awful withdrawals, then my anxiety came back quickly (ofc).. months later I attempted Effexor and Jesus Christ.. I made it 4 days and idek how I made it that far. I then attempted zoloft THREE times & lexapro. Horrible side effects. H o r r i b l e. Buspar was useless.. same w propranolol. Wellbutrin was like taking sugar pills. It did give me a really high sex drive for a week so that was fun I guess hahah. Flash forward to now. My anxiety is the worst it has ever been in my life and on top of that I have central vestibular hypofunction (iykyk..) and I’m basically as useful as a paper weight lol. I’m in therapy, physical therapy, vestibular therapy but my anxiety is so fucked. Vestibular issues and anxiety also don’t mix. So I’m at a point where I need to be fucking medicated bc I can’t live like this anymore.

I’ve changed everything. You name it and I’ve done it bc I became so against meds after my bad experiences last year. My anxiety doesn’t budge and it’s only getting worse. Oh I also was just diagnosed w ocd so that’s nice. 

Anyways;) thought I’d give meds another shot so my psych gave me viibryd to try. I did the genesight and it seemed like a good match. I didn’t see a lot of negative reviews so I felt hopeful. Day 1 was great because I took a klonopin with it, day 2 was a nightmare. After 3 hours I felt like I was on bad adderall or something I was wired. Shakey, internally buzzing, hot, my head was tingling??, SOOOOO dizzy like spinning even when I rolled over in bed. I felt so fuzzy and wired it was uncomfortable. It passed pretty quickly then the cycle repeated til 4am when I was finally able to fall asleep. The next day I woke up and had to immediately take a klonopin. I still felt pretty buzzed all day but it wasn’t horrible I guess bc the benzo. 

I called my dr and they were shocked lol.. I asked if I could take 2.5mg instead and she said yes and to take it in the morning. I haven’t yet bc I’m just scared. I’m gonna give it a few days bc I’m also ab to start my period so my mental state is even worse. Dunno if that has anything to do with it. 

I know a lot of ppl experience this w ssris and I truly am just so sensitive but like how do I push thru. It’s so uncomfortable. I just wanna feel less alone in this so I’m looking for advice. I can’t keep living w this anxiety and I don’t wanna have to keep touching benzos. I’m very careful w my use but ugh.

A lot of my anxiety centres around air hunger and a general ‘off’ feeling. 

A big trigger for me is thoughts around unexpectedly dying and my daughter being alone/having to find my dead body. She’s 14 so I have had a conversation with her about my anxiety and feelings (nothing too heavy) and we have a plan in place for an emergency. She has all relevant family numbers saved in her phone. 

A new worry I have is a fleeting thought I had earlier. I could feel the anxiety building, knew it was going to be a shit night and very briefly thought ‘maybe it would be better to be dead than live like this’. I have NEVER had a thought like this, dying is my greatest fear! 

I don’t know what the point of this post is if I’m honest, sometimes just writing my thoughts down helps. I’m also hoping maybe some people are around for a chat throughout the night. I’m UK.

reddit,Anxiety,1opu7jj,Doll-Demort666,2c3bf78f0ecc48be,Had a total meltdown last night and now I'm ashamed...,"[TLDR at the end.] I'm a 35yo female. I've struggled with my anxiety since I was very young, but as I've gotten older it's gotten worse. 

My fiancé and I have very recently started trying for a family and being obese I decided I needed to start losing weight and getting active. Before COVID, I used to do tennis 3x a week and really enjoyed it so I found a beginner program that was for beginners AND people who've been out of it for a while. Naturally, I've been very anxious about meeting new people, having a new coach, and going to new courts because a lot has changed since I've done it last. I tried signing up for another beginner program a couple years ago and got turned down bc the program wasn't really for people like me and even though I reached out to this new coach to verify, I've been scared I was gonna get turned away and be embarrassed all over again. 

The program started last night. I got home from work and had another hour and a half to kill before meeting to leave the house... so, naturally,  I was in my head the entire time... freaking myself out. Eventually, I leave the house and follow GPS to these courts I've never been to before.

I end up parking at some primary school next to the courts bc that's where the GPS took me. There were only a couple cars in the parking lot, but a decent amount of people were playing in the courts. I immediately start freaking out and having a hard time really thinking straight. 

From my car it looked like the gates were locked, but I gathered my things anyway and walked up to one gate... locked... I start to really panic. I text my fiancé throughout this whole thing bc it helps. He's trying to calm me down. I walked up to another gate... locked. I start walking around more thinking that even if I parked in the wrong spot, I could still save some embarrassment and get in. I'm waking around the entire perimeter, I turn a corner and there's a steep drop off into a ditch and decide that clearly wasn't the right way. I turned back and I'm almost crying at this point. 

I somehow got the idea to call the number located on the confirmation email when I signed up... no answer. The closer I get to my car, my breathing gets heavier, and my throat gets tighter. I get in and panic google the place... trying to find anything to help me. The number calls back and I'm trying so hard to compose myself to answer bc how fucking stupid am I? He tells me that this can happen and tells me he'll text me the location. I get the location and it's clearly wrong bc it's in another town entirely. He texts me again clarifying the road it's on which is the road I thought the GPS took me.

I start uncontrollably sobbing at this point. I've checked out and admitted defeat and I'm absolutely ashamed about it. I texted the guy and said something came up and I'll try again next week. I start hardcore negative thinking and cried the whole 20min ride home. 

When i got home my fiancé is trying his hardest to be gentle with me and cheer me up, letting me take the lead on what we do and eat for the rest of the night. I eventually pass out from exhaustion and woke up at 1:30AM and now my brain hasn't turned off since. 


TLDR: I tried going to a tennis program for my own health and parked at the wrong location. After being met with several locked gates, I had a total meltdown and left. 


I don't have any other friends who have anxiety, so I just feel stupid trying to talk to them about it. Being out of that moment, I of course could've done so many other things, but it's so hard to really think rationally and I end up following my emotions instead. I just wanted to vent.

Dude, I swear I won’t be able to tell if I’m having a heart attack one of these days. Not all the time, but maybe every 5th or 6th one I have, my panic attacks present as straight up CARDIAC EVENTS. Especially as a woman!

My breathing feels so short, I have chest discomfort (and pain sometimes) my mind races, my throat feels tight, my arm/shoulder/jaw feels tight and aching, break out into a cold sweat, I have a feeling of indigestion and nausea (haven’t actually thrown up), IMPENDING DOOM, and occasionally numbness/tingliness in limbs as well…. usually all at the same time.

Of course, these heart (panic) attacks have passed thus far. I’ve been experiencing them for about few years.

Does anyone else have anxiety or panic attacks that present this way? Please let me know, it’d provide me a lot of comfort. I experienced one last night and this morning I feel so blehugh. Freaks me out so bad. My upper back is chronically knotted from the tension.

It’s been a hard … decade. I first got very anxious when I was bullied by my boss after coming back from maternity leave. I had very severe symptoms and it came up as a complete surprise. I had no idea what was going on, waking up with panic attacks evey single day taking several hours to calm down. 

Tried a lot of meds. Did a DNA test which indicates that I have genes that make antidepressants not work well for me. It’s pure hell. 

Eventually ended up on disablity, second time now. Therapy for 7 years. I have insurance and I know I am priviledge. An other therapist too because I just wanted to go back to work. They have me on about 7 medications and it’s not working. 

I had a great career. My family is suffering from this. My daughter is anxious and depressed. My son is hanging on but not great, he’s older. My poor partner has to take care of me and the kids. I had little responsabilities and been mostly bed ridden for months now. We do go on a lot of walks and even that is not helping. Im trying to get on permanent disability but my doctor seems to think I can work. I produced a very expensive assessment that mentionned I can’t work and she is still making me see an other psychiatrist. I don’t have the fight for this. I can’t think straight, can’t focus. I can barely sleep or eat. This is so bad and i know the anxiety is making everything seem worst. But I feel so trapped. I was always a hard working woman. I’ve worked since I’m 15, sometimes, 2 jobs. I’ve pushed throught so many health issues, and collecting them (migraines, endomitriosis, uveitis, virus in my eye). Put myself through university. Climbed the ladder. 

I know I am supposed to be strong for my kids but I am not. I’ve messed everything up. And I can’t find my way out of my own head. 

I have to see the psychiatrist tomorrow for an assessment and Im terrified. It’s so dehumanizing and traumatic to be judged, evaluated… misunderstood. I also resent my doctor for not being more supportive. I feel so trap. (In canada, family doctors are not easy to come about). 

I know money is not everything but I never would have thought that my own mind would have made me not being able to provide for my family. We can’t survive on 1 income. I can’t keep a job. 

I know there are so many of you out there who are in the same boat. Some of you never even had a chance to have no anxiety for the first part of your life. Some of you still make it with anxiety. Some of you are in such worst shape than me. How do we keep going?

reddit,Anxiety,1oqeet9,Maggotboi555,9b547765dc6bf308,21yom; A guy came up to me at the gym and I'm trying not to overthink or become insecure from it,"TL;DR: Last night at the gym, a guy came over to me on the treadmill and told me if I up the Incline on the treadmill that I'd burn more. This was umprompted and I was simply walking to get my steps I'm. I'm well aware I'm a good bit overweight but I also have a lot of muscle and have been told so many times. This caught me very off guard and I've been overthinking it since, that a stranger came up to me and it feels like they called me fat without calling me fat. Idk what to do about these thoughts and if it was meant to be taken the way I took it. 

I'm 21, male, and have been working out for a few years and am pretty overweight. I've been told by plenty of people that I'm visibly muscular and kinda jacked but I'm also well aware that I'm also pretty fat according to not only my weight but also the fact that I have a large amount of flab and a belly. I don't beat myself up too much about it. It's just a fact that I have a lot of muscle and a lot of fat surrounding it too. 

Anyway, last night, I was already feeling pretty insecure and unattractive. I was on the treadmill as I usually start my gym sessions with walking. Not for cardio, not to burn calories, just to walk and get my steps in and warm up. 

Anyway, this guy, maybe a little younger than me, like 20 or so, came over the same time as me and got on the treadmill next to me and started running/jogging/sprinting for lilr 5-10 minutes. 

Then he turned it off and got my attention. I took my headphones off, still walking, and just said wassup. He pointed at the treadmill board, which was at 2.5mph and 2.5 Incline, and said something along the lines of ""hey man. If you put the Incline higher you'll burn more."" Which I was well aware of and something I've done plenty, just wasn't at the time. 

I basically just said ""uh, yeah I know. I'm just not doing that right now""

Again, paraphrasing, he said ""yeah, just if you up the Incline it burns more""

And again, I just said ""okay, yeah I know, ppreciate it"" just to get the conversation over. 

Anyway, the rest of that time I was thinking ""um, did I just get called fat? That was so weird. I hope that wasn't as rude as it came across. That was kinda ignorant."" And the rest of the time i was just thinking about it and got insecure. 

Anyway, whether I'm fat or not is a me problem. I'm more concerned if i should take that as what I'm taking it as and what do to about the thoughts.

reddit,Anxiety,1oqec4u,kargo86,3552a99081ae18cd,My PCP recommended Zoloft/Lexapro and Hydroxyzine but I'm not sure about it...,"Hello,

I wanted to get your advice about if I should start any of these medications. I'm 26, female, and have struggled with anxiety since I was about 15. I have never been medicated before. I have made *a lot* of progress in my anxiety from when I was a teenager.

Around this time last year, my mom passed away from a very rare and aggressive cancer which came out of nowhere and it really shocked me to my core. I spent 4 months living in the hospital with her. She was my only parent and she was older (69). I was essentially her caregiver my entire adult life because she was disabled from various accidents/falls. After she passed, my brother went into a paranoid schizophrenic episode that he is now medicated for as of a month ago. I have been dealing with all of the legal matters myself involving my mom. All of my other family is deceased on her side and I have never known my dad's side of the family.

My mom was my best friend and now I feel so alone. Just thinking of my mom drives me to tears and I have done a good job just trying to manage, but lately it's had a chokehold on me because it's been almost a year in December. I went to the doctor yesterday for the first time as an adult and I discussed my concerns about anxiety and wanting to get genetic testing done for this rare cancer. The NP suggested I take either Lexapro or Zoloft with Hydroxyzine to help me sleep.

I used to take Unisom and Benadryl every single night to help me sleep until it didn't work anymore, and now I have been taking 15 mg of melatonin per night for the last year. My mind is constant and I'm always worried about how I'm going to be able to survive on my own especially financially as my living situation is still not entirely under control. Most days of the week, I can manage. But about 1 or 2 days of the week, I'm hysterical, just crying and feeling like I wish I had people around that I could spend time with or even just get a hug from.

Because I told her that I struggled with anxiety in the past, she wrote that I have chronic anxiety that was exacerbated by my mom's passing last year, and that it's giving me insomnia. I don't necessarily feel like I want to rely on a medication to take everyday, especially something that is like an antidepressant, but maybe something that can be taken as needed for when I have a random anxiety attack having to do with my situation.

I don't really know what I can ask for that's reasonable. I declined counseling because I feel that I have already talked enough about my situation with doctors and other people in my life. This was my first appointment with her and she said that I could go in for a blood draw tomorrow and then on the following week, we could discuss the results of the labs as well as what I would like to decide as far as her treatment plan goes.

Is there anything that is more short-term that I could ask for? With it being the one year anniversary of my mom's passing coming up soon, I'm devastated and I'm trying to just hold it together as best as I can.

Any advice would be really appreciated, thank you.",1,8,2025-11-06T23:20:40+00:00,https://reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/1oqec4u/my_pcp_recommended_zoloftlexapro_and_hydroxyzine/,Negative

I am just looking for some advice/tips or even people that are going through the same thing.

In the last 6 years or so I have been on anti depressants (Citalopram) and something to help me sleep (Seroquel). 

I really hate myself for having to be on these and wish I was ""normal"" but as the title states, I take Seroquel every night to sleep, I do not think I would fall asleep without it, as I do get tired and exhausted at night but not sleepy to the point of sleeping. 

But, if I have my GF over or say I go camping or to someone's house to sleep, there is almost 100% chance I will not have a good sleep or fall asleep at all. I just think I get to fixated on the change and cant shut my mind off, and my brain just seems to be on constant alert of sounds and movement.

Has any of you been through a similar situation and have made things better?

I’ve struggled with intrusive thoughts for a while and I constantly feel the need to check things and get reassurance from people about certain things. I’ve never been diagnosed with ocd but I feel like I have it. Ever since my baby was born, it’s gotten worse. I’ve fully convinced myself on multiple occasions that I gave my baby my dog’s seizure medicine instead of giving it to the dog just because I don’t have a clear memory of giving it to the dog. I would wait a little bit and see if he showed any symptoms and once I was sure he was okay then I could relax. Mind you I had no memory of giving it to my baby I just also couldn’t clearly remember giving it to the dog because it was such a mundane and everyday task that I assumed since I couldn’t remember giving it to the dog that I must’ve given it to my baby instead. I’ve had instances in the past way before being pregnant where I’ve fully convinced myself that something occurred and obsessed about it for weeks only to eventually realize it never did. Usually when intrusive thoughts come since being postpartum I’m able to push them away. Sometimes I’ll dwell on them for a moment and be disturbed but I usually forget about them within the day. The other day, I had an intrusive thought and it’s completely spiraled into a 3 day event full of anxiety, panic, shame and guilt over something I’m 100 % never occurred. I was giving my baby a bath and it was his first time using his new bathtub which is a sit up seat type bathtub. It was kinda hard to wash his private area and his butt so I remember just putting soap on my hand and trying to clean the diaper cream off of him since he hadn’t had a bath in a few days because I was waiting for his new tub to come. The details are a little hazy since I’ve thought about it so much but after using my hand to clean him I was hit with an intrusive thought: was what I just did inappropriate? I sort of brushed it aside and got him out of the bath and I remembered being a little agitated over the thought because whenever I get intrusive thoughts like that they make me feel guilty and disgusting. I went about my day only thinking about it here and there and I remember even googling how other moms wash their baby in the bath to see if anyone used their hand because I felt so weird about it. The thought continued and then for the past few days since then it’s spiraled into me being convinced that I did something inappropriate for my own malicious gain and just immediately blocked it out. I keep telling myself that I love my baby and I would never do that or have any desire to do that and I feel disgusted at the thought. But everytime I try to tell myself it’s okay and that it’s just an intrusive thought I had that’s turned into a false memory, there’s a voice in the back of my mind that’s like what if you really did it and just don’t remember? What if you touched him inappropriately on purpose and you’re trying to cover it up? The thought has made me completely panicked for three days and it’s taking over my life. My baby is my whole world and I would never do that and I know I didn’t but I can’t get over the thought of what if I did. And theres not even a false memory of it I have no memory of doing anything inappropriate but I’ve still convinced myself I did. Sorry for the long post I just don’t know what to do. This has sent me into a depression and it’s affected my relationship with my baby. If anyone has any advice I would appreciate it.

I have panic attacks at night and my brain will randomly remind me of these things when I try not to to think about them and it will ruin my day. Even small things and mistakes I make throughout my day will cause my heart to sink. This literally feels like a curse. I can’t keep living like this, and I know people will say “there is nothing you can do about it and you just have to learn to live with it” but it’s so hard. Things are constantly being added onto the weight of what I already have to deal with. I literally shudder at the sound of my own name because I am so embarrassed to be me. I hate myself.

Also please don't tell me to find faith or religion. I appreciate the good intentions beneath the sentiment but I don't think my faith (or lack there of) will change. 


I'm currently working through some issues with my therapist and one of the things is I get really sad and blue whenever an event is over and I essentially have to return to my routine day to day. A major component of that is almost panic and being alone. I'm working on sitting with the emotion and feeling it and reflecting on it.

As I sit here doing just that I have realized that I feel like I'm trying to grasp at the occasion/moment/event and it feels like it went by too quickly. I enjoy myself and afterwards it feels like I can't account for where the time went. I want to grasp if and hold it. As I get older it feels like time on a whole is slipping away and I'm scared.

I realised as I was reflecting that maybe it's because there's a subconscious link between being alone and death and the end. And the relationship to time.

I don't know how to process it. I've always had death anxiety and I know I need to work on it. Up until now my coping mechanism has been ignoring it and pretending it doesn't exist. 

The person I looked up to and role modeled died almost a decade ago. Towards the end I saw them like I'd never seen and they were afraid. So was my grandparents.

I'm more agnostic than atheist and I guess I'm just reaching for other non faith based invidials to see if there is any insight that perhaps my therapist may not have.

I just know that on a whole being alone is often very scary for me. And the though of being alone for eternity terrifies me to the point that typing this gives me a borderline panic. But I want to improve on it and start healing it.

If you have any insight or thoughts please id love your perspectives.

reddit,OffMyChest,1oq7bm6,Professional-Art1605,18a47afe3306e684,my brother committed suicide and i am elated,"for the first eight years of my life i was physically and sexually abused by my older brother. he was eight years older than me. he would regularly break my toys, mentally torment me, beat me and make me beg to stop, spit in my mouth, force me to watch gore and rape content, rape my face and ejaculate in my mouth, and piss all over me, all while laughing maniacally. he left my skull permanently disfigured from physical abuse as an infant when my skull was still soft

no one knew the extent of this. my parents and sister knew he would break my stuff and beat me, but they didn't know the extent of the physical abuse, nor anything about the sexual abuse. he would tell me that he would rape and torture me to death if i told anyone the details. it was a credible threat, and became more so as life went on

he dropped out of high school and went to some kind of camp for troubled teens after he got expelled from school for severely beating a classmate. from there, he joined the military and had a long career there, followed by fedboi mercenary scumbag life. my family revered him as a shining example of turning life around

while him leaving for the military was somewhat of an escape from his wrath, it only reinforced the credence of his threats. he literally dedicated his life to being a professional killer. i told two people through my life that i was abused as a child, but gave no further detail of how or when or by whom. i couldn't, because i was paralyzed by fear

he would always tell me his retirement plan was a bullet. well, a few days ago, he shot himself

my first reaction was extreme joy. not only is my abuser dead, but i am now free to finally work through the pain i have been holding inside me for three decades. i'm not a psychopath, and i do feel empathy and sadness for everybody in my family who misses him because they didn't know him like i did

however, lately i have been experiencing sustained anger. because not only did he beat me to [redacted]ing him, but he also fucking got away with everything with no consequences. my only solace is the hope that memories of what he subjected me to tormented him until the end

overall though, i am mostly relieved and happy that i can talk through these issues without crippling fear. i have a lot wrong with me stemming from the abuse and have needed to address it for so long. now i finally can

the main thing fucking me up right now is that everybody in my family is coming to me feeling sorry and expecting me to be sad. still, no one knows. this post is the first time i have laid out the details. i don't know how to confront them at his service, or if i'll even go. whatever

That's right!"" or ""He's helping Danielle with that painting she was working on!"" and she'd giggle with ""She's such a good artist.""

It went into various responses to her drawing off the memories & experiences I was with her to remember. My inconsolable husband, however, would turn his head away because it was paining him that his mother's brain had no memory.

Her eyes came back - opened wide - and so did her immediate mind.   
  
""I love you, you know?""   
  
She smiled big and was absolutely right there, ""I love you too!""   
  
I wrapped myself around her and yeah I was involuntarily crying into her neck. I was the non-blood relative trying to be strong for her and also my husband but damn. Smelling her, seeing her come back? I really tried to contain it.

Her son/my husband - who could hold his entire heartbreak at seeing a robotic version of repetitious nonsense by turning away from her...finally came over with me as he saw me bury my face into his Mom's neck (could probably tell from my heaving-trying-not-to-cry body I was trying not to sob too hard).  
  
When I felt him beside me... I pulled away from her and happily (smile and all) said, ""Look who is here beside me!"" I stepped away and aside.

Her entire body seized upward and her big smile turned into a beam of light:  
""That's my beautiful baby boy! Where have you been?"" He hugged her so deeply and said, ""I love you Mom. I've been right here, waiting for you.""   
  
She responded, ""I love YOU & I've been waiting for you too. I'm glad you're here."" 

We were able to engage in small chit-chat before we left & I think, we both knew that was really it.

reddit,OffMyChest,1opqnlq,fantomefille,44bf1ea12779ffb9,I’m watching my dad burn down a 40-year marriage for nothing — and I don’t recognize him anymore.,"
I never thought I’d be here. My parents have been married for over 40 years. I grew up in a stable Catholic home — my mom led the PTA, my dad coached my soccer team, and we took family trips to Disney every year. They were the couple everyone looked up to.

I’m 32 and living with them right now because of a chronic illness that’s left me temporarily disabled. I’m in therapy to regain my independence, but in the meantime, I’m stuck watching this from the front row.

My dad has what he calls a “friendship” with a woman from his music group. She’s a widow, and they got close after her husband passed away. But it’s not friendship — it’s an emotional affair. Constant texts. Long phone calls. Secret meetups. Turning off his phone location.

This all came to light in June, but my mom and I have pieced together enough to believe it started months before — maybe even while the woman’s husband was still alive. That thought makes me sick. My dad used to be the kind of man who’d never blur those lines. I don’t know how to reconcile that with the version of him now.

He even told my mom it’s “either she stays in my life or there’s no marriage.” He swears nothing physical happened, but then says “God understands my heart.” As if that makes it okay. As if faith has become his shield against accountability.

My mom’s devastated. She’s been tracking his location, showing up where he goes, just trying to hang on. Last month, she started sleeping in the guest room upstairs. They’ve shared a bed for over 40 years. That’s when it really sank in — something sacred has cracked.

She even confronted both of them. She showed up during a four-hour “coffee outing” and sat down. The woman acted pious and calm, claiming they’re just “friends growing closer to God.” 

My dad came home from church one day saying, almost smugly, that “God is still on my side.” He told my mom he “stole the woman’s heart.” Then he looked at me and asked, “What is your mom really losing by me having this friend?”

What I can’t stop asking myself is: why is this random woman worth trading everything for?
A marriage. A family. His reputation. His faith. Forty years of connection. Why is she worth burning it all down?

He thinks he’s entitled to privacy — that as long as “nothing physical happened,” no one has the right to judge him. I told him the truth always comes out. Part of me wonders if putting this whole thing on blast would be the only way to wake him up.

They’ve started counseling, but even the therapist looked stunned. He referred them both out for individual sessions. Their new appointments are next week.

I don’t know what happens after that. Two of my three brothers know, but no one talks. The silence feels like mourning.

I’m trying to support my mom, but it’s draining. Every day feels heavier. And every time I look at my dad, I see someone I don’t recognize anymore.

Sometimes I just sit with the questions that keep me up at night:
Is the man I cherished as my dad still in there?
Will he ever snap out of this?
And if he doesn’t… how do I ever trust him again?
How do I trust any man again, after watching the best one I knew burn everything down for nothing?

TL;DR:
My 74-year-old dad is having an emotional affair with a widow from his music group. My 69-year-old mom knows, and it’s destroying her. He uses faith to justify it and refuses to cut contact. They’ve started marriage counseling, but the therapist immediately referred them to individual sessions. My mom recently moved into the guest room.

I know this isn’t normal. I know it’s not how a healthy relationship should be. He doesn’t respect me, and honestly, I don’t know how to get that respect back. I just wish I had a normal relationship  one where disagreements don’t turn into being cursed at or emotionally drained.

I’m not innocent either. I’ve had my moments, but I’ve been trying to be better, especially now that we have kids. I don’t want them growing up thinking this is what love looks like.

He gets triggered whenever I criticize him or have an “attitude,” and it’s like he goes from 0 to 100 in seconds. When it happens, I usually just stay quiet and take it, because I’m trying to be calm, but inside I’m boiling. I’m so angry at him but I’m trying to be better so I just have to take the abuse.  Every time he does it, it’s another reminder that he broke his promise again.

He always apologizes later, says he hates himself for talking to me that way. But at this point, I don’t even want the apologies. He’ll wait until the next day, or he’ll buy me food like that’s supposed to fix it. I don’t even want that anymore. 

I don’t know how to fix something that’s been broken this long. I just know I don’t want to live like this forever. I’ve given up hope that this will change. When things are good everything is great, he’s an amazing dad and care taker but he turns into a whole other beast when he gets angry and verbally abuses me like this, it’s like he wants to take me down to his level. I’m trying hard to stay good and not lose my cool, I just don’t even know if it’s worth it anymore.

My brother passed away last year. He was 25, and it still doesn’t feel real.

His toothbrush has been sitting in our shared bathroom since the day he left. I cleaned around it. Dusted the holder. But I couldn’t throw it away. It felt like the last trace of him, his literal DNA sitting there, proof he existed.

Yesterday, I finally did it. I threw it away. My hands were shaking the whole time.

I thought I’d feel guilty, but instead I just felt… still. Like I’d been holding my breath for a year and finally exhaled.

Grief is weird. It’s not just crying and missing someone. Sometimes it’s staring at a toothbrush and realizing what “gone” really means.",116,17,2025-11-06T19:11:57+00:00,https://reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/1oq7xv1/i_threw_away_my_brothers_toothbrush_and_finally/,Negative
reddit,OffMyChest,1oq57wn,Slight_Interest_8058,2493907e178b0142,Found out my Fiancé is a pedophile,"This is a throw away account for obvious reasons. So on Halloween I found my fiancé was cheating. On an anonymous chat app. I was absolutely shattered. I trusted him with my life. I’m recently disabled and I depend on because I can’t even work a remote job without my medical issues interfering with my job. I quit my job after they threatened to fire me for passing out because they wouldn’t listen when I told them I was going to.

I read through some of the messages to kind of gauge what he was doing. He had told people he was single, living with a friend, told people I left him to start an OF with “someone bigger”, and told some i was sick and dying so he hadn’t gotten any in months. He told a few that I only wanted him for the money and I never cared for him. I paid most of bills for over a year working close to it 70 hours a week while he barely broke 30hours a week. I cared for him not his money. 

But worse of all was the fantasies he had. About raping women. I’m a rape victim. I have been since I was 15. I was a victim of online grooming by the age of 11. I think he likes the fact that I’m a rape victim now that I know what he likes. And it’s just so sick.

But I never broke up with him because I am dependent on him now and I’m trapped here. I have no family or friends here and no way out. Well the other night I just couldn’t stop thinking about the messages and I just had to know exactly what he said to people. So I read the rest of the messages. He was talking to girls who claimed to be between the ages of 13-17. He’s 23. The supposed 13 year old sent a photo of a girl who definitely was around that age. And he told her to take her shirt off. He told a 15 year old age doesn’t matter. Told her she needed the practice. There’s so much more but I’m sick thinking about it.

I’ve been so sick since I found out. My sisters are 16 and 14 right now. They see him as family and even introduce him as such. They trusted him and so did I. I made him block their socials on everything. I don’t want him talking to them. I’m scared for the kids he talked to. I want to leave so bad. But I can’t work without going to the hospital and I don’t want to burden somebody else.

I feel like a bad person for not turning him in but truth be told, everything anonymous so I don’t think they can actually do anything to him. And then I’d be fucked. He isn’t who I thought he was so who knows what he’s really capable of, ya know? I’m so scared. I’m so sick to my stomach. God I feel so sick. I’ve been living with a monster. He’s such a disgusting human being.

I fled from Sam 17 years ago because of DV and his drug/alcohol addiction. Of course that wasn’t how our relationship started but it was how it ended. The night I left, he tried to throw us both down a flight of stairs. I know I made the right choice leaving, but it was a hard life as a single mom. I had to work a lot to take care of us. If anyone is wondering my child support order was only $12 per week. Our life wasn’t glamorous but we had what we needed. Arthur was safe and loved and I really thought that was enough. Sam disappeared from Arthur’s life until he was about 6 when the court granted him supervised visits. After that Sam would randomly appear and disappear in Arthur’s life. When arthur was about 15, Sam started to call him all the time. He swore he was a changed man. He started sending him money, making him promises for fun trips….and showing him the house he just bought. I’m not going to lie that it really hurt I wasn’t able to give Arthur all those things. It was all I could do to keep a roof over our heads and food on the table. So now here we are. Arthur is 18 and wants to start trade school. Sam says he’ll pay for Arthur’s school, a car and give him spending money if he moves in with him. My son told me this way is easier for him to make a life and he’s going. I’m gutted. Has anyone else had this happen? Please tell me how you accepted it and kept your heart from shattering into a million pieces.

reddit,OffMyChest,1oq1gmv,BallsNyoJawzz,b70818ca31634802,I can’t stand my “friend” (nsfw),"I put friend in quotations cause I have not considered her my friend in a very long time, but it’s too difficult to cut her out of my life cause she’s soooo intertwined in my friend group. I’m just gonna make a bullet list of things she’s done.

-asked my friend (g, f18) if she knew if a guy was single. G said technically yes but that her and said guy had been having sex for a while . “Friend” asked again if she could have sex with him, g said no, “friend” did it anyways. In MY apartment. Without asking me. And the blamed it on the guy and said “well he said g wouldn’t mind” but g had already previously stated that she DID mind

-treated my apartment as if it was hers. Was constantly inviting herself over, even at the worst times, without asking. So I have a roomate, (V, m20) and I had just gotten off a 15 hour babysitting job at almost 3:30 am. It was an almost hour drive home so by the time I got home, it was almost 4:30 am. V texts me and is like, hey “friend” is coming over, and I’m like ummmm??? She didn’t ask me?? And she has never asked me. And we were trying to tell her she couldn’t come over and she did anyways and fell asleep on my couch, without asking if she could even sleep over. This would continue for a very long time of her treating our apartment like it was hers.

-constantly lies and makes shit up for attention 

-will throw herself at any guy we bring around for attention, it got to the point that I had to tell my boyfriend (A, m20) that I couldn’t leave them in a room alone, not because I didn’t trust him but because I won’t have “friend” flirting with him to try and get a rise out of me

-she constantly has to be the center of attention, going as far as making a scene and leaving birthday parties early because no one was treating her with the spotlight (dude it’s obviously not your day, get over yourself)

But the biggest thing that just happened, is we have 2 friends (H, m25 and A, f25) who have been together for almost a year and a half and it’s a very serious relationship between them. Well, on Halloween, she made a big deal abt them coming over cause she “didn’t want to put pants on” and everyone was like… why? None of us have pants on, why is it a big deal? (My friend group is very close) and she goes “well, I don’t think A would like it if I wasn’t wearing pants cause me and H used to fuck” and then made a hand motion. Which was a very weird thing to suddenly bring up now and never once before, so I called bullshit and texted A abt it. A confronted “friend” about her behavior and now “friend” is trying to turn it around and say she would never ever say something like that and she’s so distraught and sick to her stomach over this and is gaslighting all my friends that she would never say something like that.

I’m honestly so sick of her awful behavior, there’s even more I didn’t want to type out, but Jesus fuck she is such a horrible person but I can’t get rid of her without losing all my other friends!

Yeah so I guess it is as bad as it sounds but I just kinda came to this realisation 

So I really had no idea how masturbation worked when I was younger, I knew it included your genitals and there was the possibility of it going wrong and getting hurt but it’s primary reason was to feel good. I lost my virginity when I was 12. Not good I know, but I knew at some point it was something I would want to do and at the time it felt like that was my one opportunity to do it and to be able to say I have done it. 

When I was 16 my friends had asked me about it and the conversation kind of diverged into a discussion on masturbation. And during the conversation I was too ashamed to ask what the heck they were talking about because I should have known 
 

Yeah so I didnt like my clit for a majority of my life. It has nothing to do with sexual experiences but having just a little sack of flesh pop out is kind of weird and scared me away from acknowledging it when I was younger. I had no idea until I was 18 that it could feel that good. 

So yeah i just think it’s a little crazy that I knew how men masturbate at that age but the clit seemed like a fucking myth. ",29,14,2025-11-06T23:50:58+00:00,https://reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/1oqf209/i_had_sex_before_i_knew_what_masturbation_was/,Negative

reddit,OffMyChest,1oqpdv9,ThrowRA-Bromine,01db8427a6cd6751,I realized that I've sexually harassed/SA'd(?) my friend and I can't live knowing what I've done.,"My best friend (20F) has been the only light in my life for the past few years. I've been depressed, suicidal, isolating myself away in my room because I'm afraid of the world.

I became INCREDIBLY addicted to porn during this time. Moreso than I already was. It became my only real way to cope with my world breaking down around me. It honestly became a compulsion to consume this stuff when any amount of stress or triggers showed up.

My friend unfortunately fell victim to my creepiness. I would engage sexual talks with her, make sexual jokes, hoping she would reciprocate. She does, sometimes, and if she told me to stop, I would, but still. I've been fairly pushy on a number of occasions.

Something else I've been really stuck up on is if I've sexually assaulted her. I don't really wanna give details. (partially because I'm genuinely struggling to remember the events clearly and there's some false memory stuff involved.) But the idea that there's a decent chance that I did is destroying me. Whether she realizes what I did or not.

I've felt absolutely fucking terrible about who I've been. My friend tells me that I'm overreacting about feeling so guilty about it, that she doesn't even remember most of this stuff happening, and sometimes she even thinks it's funny that I get so worried about it. (At one point I said something stupid and was just groaning and cringing about it, while she was just giggling up a storm on the other end.)

Despite her forgiveness and her actively wanting me in her life, I haven't been able to cope with my actions. Regardless of whether or not what I did counts as SA, I have just straight up been a major creep, that's just a fact. It's been a week since I've said anything to her. I just simply disappeared. She sent me a meme randomly a few hours ago and I just haven't said anything to her. And I hate myself for it.

I simply can't live with the fact that I am the way I am, now that I've realized it. I have always hated people who take advantage of others and who commit sexual assault. Words cannot describe the hate I feel towards myself knowing I've become like every other creep in the world, and I hate how my friend still wants me in her life.",4,4,2025-11-07T08:53:13+00:00,https://reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/1oqpdv9/i_realized_that_ive_sexually_harassedsad_my/,Negative

I’ve turned off reply notifications now as the admin was becoming crazy but thankyou so much for the replies (with the exception of the trolls). Without them I wouldn’t have had the courage to do what had to be done. 


So as above really. Me (24f) and my best friend were out for drinks last weekend and she accidentally came across a ‘picture’ my bf had sent me. She made a jokey comment and we moved on but at some point she must have sent it to herself because later that night she shared it on the group chat were on with 6 other friends from school with the caption ‘hope Abi’s better at faking it then she is at hiding max’s little secret’ 

I didn’t see it till late the next morning and told her to take  it down straight away but everyone had already seen it. She apologised half heartedly but now she’s acting like I’m being unreasonable for still being mad.

I mean yes it’s my fault for not remembering it was on my phone but to send it herself and share it like that is completely over the line. I haven’t told my bf yet but I’ll have to eventually and it’s just going to add to his insecurities.

Drunk or not why would she even think that was ever going to be ok or remotely funny?! 😠 

*update. Thanks for the feedback, I hadn’t expected my rant to attract quite so much attention. I have now ended the friendship and also left the group chat. I told my bf this morning and we’re discussing it further tonight. He was undeservingly forgiving of me but quite rightly furious at what she did.

I love my partner, I love the sex we have and have no desire to cheat on them...but theres something about the exhilarating arousal of casual sex and hook ups that I miss. Yea, maybe the sex itself wasnt great everytime but I still miss it. 

Perhaps part of it is also an ego related thing, wanting to feel desired and craved by getting with multiple people. Maybe its cuz theres fantasies that arent fulfilled. I dont know. Maybe its just a part of being young and in my early 20s, that im not ready for that ""settled down"" part of my life. Whatever the reason, sometimes it makes me wish I was single again. But I love my partner, and ill never leave them or cheat. So these feelings will just have to remain feelings and desires until they go away.

If it causes World War 3, so be it.","I want to start by saying this might be long because I’m angry, but I’ll try to make it clear and simple. So I’m a 21 year old female and today I cut off two people from my family: my ex-aunt Katherine and ex-uncle John (from my mum’s side). They’ve always caused drama. Katherine sticks her nose into everything and acts like she knows best, and John is constantly yelling, snapping and taking his anger out on everyone. Being around them is like walking on eggshells.

The first real issue was when my dad was diagnosed with MS a few months ago. Instead of showing any concern, Katherine said, “It’s not MS, he’s fine. He’s faking it. Emily just doesn’t want to work. She’s 21 and needs to grow up.” but she hasn’t seen him in ages so she doesn't see him struggling every day to do simple things and she’s not a doctor. And I’m literally his carer right now while we get things sorted so I can't work, so that comment hurt. But as usual I stayed quiet mainly becasue I didn’t have the energy to deal with her but I also didn't want to cause a argument so I let it go. 

Bu then Father’s Day came. We always celebrate at their house every year, eveyone went to theres (everyoneon my mums side). Now my parents are divorced, but everyone still gets along with my dad, so I asked if I could bring him as its the first fathers day his not woking and i didnt want to go and celebrate fathers day without my dad so i didn't  think it was a problem to ask and Katherine told me yes to my face she said it was fine for me to bring him But a few days later she didn’t even speak to me directly,  she got my other aunty to call and say, “Your dad isn’t welcome. He’s not part of our family. We all hate him.” Which is a lie, because everyone except John and Katherine still loves him. So I said if my dad isn’t welcome, I’m not going and left it at that and it wasn't talked about again.

Then my Par (my dad’s dad) passed away. And two days after he passed I went to my cousin’s birthday because I wanted to be there for him and Katherine looked at me, dead in the eyes and said, “Oh, I didn’t think you’d be upset. He wasn’t even a good grandfather.” like what, who says that to someone who is grieving? But again i kept my mouth shut because I didn’t want to ruin a child’s birthday.

Now last week my aunty told me John has been talking about me. He said I “need to keep my mouth shut, stop having opinions, and that I’m not allowed to invite my dad to anything because he’s not welcome.” alot more was said that I can't say on reddit. Now I have literally never done anything to them. I’ve helped with their kids, supported them, stayed quiet to avoid drama and somehow I’m still the problem.

So I’m done. No more Christmas, Easter, birthdays, nothing. If they are there, I’m not. I don’t care if my nan gets mad because she always chooses them and defends them. I’m 21 now and I don’t have to put up with toxic people just because we’re related. I’m done letting them talk shit about me and especially about my dad.

They are no longer my family.

He's been with me since we were literal kids, we've seen each other's victories. We moved away from college but eventually got together again when we both started our jobs and turns out we moved to the same place. He's seriously the kindest person you could ever know.

We've been on a few trips together both locally and overseas. We planned another local one and it was really exciting. Our route for this one was a train and a bus with long rides, but it was okay. We spent the train ride playing Overcooked, and showed me the first episode of Sopranos because it's his favorite show. I brought the game but was happier watching Sopranos, because he was literally grinning the whole time. He really loved that show a lot. He offered to lend me his DVDs after I said I liked it.

When we got on the bus, it was already pretty late so we both fell asleep as soon as hopped on. I remember waking up and we were near a rest stop, so I was shaking his arm and telling him it was time to go eat. At first I wasn't bothered that he wasn't responding because this dude is a HEAVY sleeper so I just shook him again. But when I was doing that over and over, I basically paused because something felt really wrong. I put my hand near his nose and I realized he wasn't breathing. I was hoping and praying that maybe I was just being stupid but when I pulled back to stare at him, it looked to be true. There he was, wrapped up in this Scarface hoodie he'd been wearing since high school, headphones on, but he was literally just a corpse. I wanted to break down immediately but I just held it in because I didn't want to freak other people out on the bus.

Even then, I was so freaked the fuck out. Like it didn't feel real at all and I waited until the rest stop and most people getting down before I ran up to the bus driver and saying that my friend just fucking died next to me. Since then it's literally just been a whirlwind of shit, and now we know that he died of some heart thing that NO ONE, even his family, knew he had. It's not like I've never experienced death but having next to me just made this shit feel too real.

It feels so weird typing this down knowing he isn't around. His family gave me his DVDs of the Sopranos because apparently, he's been meaning to give them to me for ages.

reddit,OffMyChest,1oqnq7n,Any_Alfalfa_2254,7c18a2e198127467,I feel like I have missed out on life.,"I am 31 years old and currently in a situation, where I feel too old to be young and too young to be old. Basically, I had to realise 3 years ago, why I am the way I am, why everything turned out the way it is and why a lot of things went wrong in my life. It's basically emotional neglect and emotional abuse from childhood. Constantly changing environments and behaviour from those around me. Nothing ever felt safe and loneliness was like a default state. I couldn't let anyone really near me. Now, as I am somewhat healthier and my depression is more mild, I am more open to try out new things. I thought about going to university, so I checked out some courses. And it was just depressing. How fucking young the people look. They are looking like teenagers. It actually made me realise how far behind I am in life. Students in my imagination were always those very adult people. But it felt like I am surrounded by teenagers. I spent my younger years, which were supposed to explore and having adventures or seeing the world, in a depressed fight or flight mode. I surrounded myself with unhealthy people. Not fucking once I experienced true love or actual affection. I don't really know how emotionally healthy people connect. I look back and see with sadness, that there actually were a lot of people who wanted to have a connection with me. It's just that I totally didn't know how to do that, because I never could express (nor acknowledge) my needs, neither did I knew that sometimes people actually like you for who you are and you don't have to ""earn"" anything. And it's a cycle that's so hard to overcome, especially now, that I am 31 and feel more and more inadequate, because I don't have the things in my life, which others have. I feel like 23 years old, in the body of a 31 year old, with the life standards of a 18 year old, with some experiences or knowledge only very sad 50 year olds have. I just don't get it together, and people notice sometimes, that you are somewhat ""different"" because of your experiences. It's humiliating and alienating to feel, like people actually reject you because of the hardships you had to deal with in life, and it wasn't ever really your fault. It's like everyone is playing a video games in which they know the rules, the way, every quest leads to the next step and there's a clear goal. And you just got thrown in it and have to figure out everything by yourself. It's like they developed their core in their younger years and I developed also one, but it's distorted, confused and constantly changing like the way I had to grow up. And people rather look down on you if you're struggling and even like to humiliate you because if that. It somewhat feels perverse, to realise that the more you hide your hardships and your pain the more accepted you are. It gives you the feeling you get punished even further because of the unfortunate childhood you had.",3,2,2025-11-07T07:05:39+00:00,https://reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/1oqnq7n/i_feel_like_i_have_missed_out_on_life/,Negative

My main reason for not breaking up with him is because I live with him (I'm currently a minor & another reason I won't mention because I feel like it would be traced back to me but is a major part of why I can't move out) now to the main point of this post is because all of the things listed above + more that I won't mention as I don't want this being traced back to me, I'm not one to obsess over looking through my partners phone but recently he's been turning his screen away from me while we're next to each other he did this earlier and when I leaned over to see what it was he was quick to switch to a different app, so I checked his phone and he's been talking to his ex and has her added on multiple social media platforms and was talking to her on an app he says he ""never uses"".
Anyway I don't feel bad anymore I do not care about him the way I did before I seen that nor do I love him, I'm not heartbroken, I just feel like I'm seeing things clearly for the first time in a long time I've let him slide with looking up weird things on his phone but I draw the line here, I am not a doormat to be walked all over all I know is as soon as I'm able to I will leave him, move out, and be single for awhile.

It’s been 4 months since then and recently B who A has talked to a few times during class groupings started joining us which i don’t really mind. Since they two have been the ones talking, B and i are just mutuals of A but of course since we are in the same friend group we are starting to be friends.

However, ever since B joined us I’ve felt so left out of the group. A and B would usually have long conversations with each other where i would always try to join in but feels like there’s no space for me to. Whenever i do join it it just feels the conversation has stopped and they move on to a different topic talking to each other. 

I’m also the one who’s like the “Leader” of the group as im the one who always walks at the front as I usually walk fast but i try to slow down to talk to them but they don’t seem to turn to me. They both also seem to depend on me and is on autopilot so i always have to be at the front navigating them as they stand side by side behind chatting.

They would also sit next to each other leaving me alone, and now whenever i try to talk to either of them it feels like the vibes are off. I noticed how B would always follow through with what A is saying, expanding the conversation whilst with me no matter how hard i try to continue it it always ends. Same whenever I talk to A where she just stopped conversing with me. They are the type to look at each other whenever something big happens which sucks as I try to look at the but no ones looking at me.

Its just starting to get really annoying being left out where i wished i should’ve just went to places by myself as that’s what I feel like anyways when im with them .",3,1,2025-11-07T08:15:16+00:00,https://reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/1oqot4g/being_alone_in_a_friend_group_of_three_despite/,Negative

My boss is a pain in the ass that 'works' 100% home office and makes phone calls all the time to demand unreasonably large tasks to be delivered in very short deadlines. The money is not enough for bills and food. I took two technical courses, an open course, and started a degree program to get this job. Other companies won't accept me because they require at least two years of experience and a referral from an internal employee. I try to endure it, and all I have with me during the day is some manga to read, dipyrone, and an antidepressant that barely works.

I try to be grateful because many people don't have jobs and don't have food to eat or bed to sleep, but this is no way to live either. It's humiliating at times.

Last monday my head hurted so bad and suddenly half my body got weak. I haven't been going to work since then. If I fell there ain't no way my boss would move his unhelpful lazy ass to help me. If I die they will just find someone else to replace me and laugh afterwards. I know this because of the day I was eating my lunch and I heard some people laughing about a colleague that unalived herself. It's an awful feeling going home with nothing to give to my family but I can't go back into that office. I'm going to sell food to earn some money until I find another job idk. Why do the worst people end up becoming company bosses?

I don't expect any workplace to be amaaaazing but god that place is hell. Sometimes some people just forget to be a civilized and minimally respectful adult and this always baffles me. I just need some money to pay my bills why does it have to be difficult? I have no patience for people anymore. 

And to my boss: There's no point in calling and texting me all day. I won't answer. I'm sick, I'm not at work. There's no ""URGENCY"", there's no ""FOR NOW!!', for me the only ""urgency"" and ""for now"" is someone collapsing and needing immediate help. WHICH IS NOT THE CASE

reddit,OffMyChest,1opvlr0,ParfaitOptimal1124,45b2b646a15a7ab6,My ex left me for his friends girlfriend,"
About three years ago, my ex (M22) randomly told me he wasn’t in love with me (F21) anymore. I thought it was a joke until he said he was “in love” with his friend’s girlfriend.

That man was my first love. My high school sweetheart. The first person I ever slept with. I thought he was emotionally mature, grounded, and real. I thought he loved me for me — but apparently, he just loved being liked.

When I asked him why, he said, “You’re pretty, but you’re not thick enough. You’re just not mature.” Then he compared me directly to his friend’s girlfriend. Like, actually said her name.

And then this man went to their workplace, confessed his “love” for her, told her h , told her he could treat her better than his friend could, and basically embarrassed himself — and me — in front of everyone.

Her boyfriend (aka his friend) found out and messaged me. We swapped info, realized my ex had been doing the most behind both our backs. I ended up talking to the whole friend group, including the girl, and she kinda laughed about it. That part stung. But his other friends actually comforted me and said I was out of his league.

Now, this is where I made my mistake. One of his friends - the most attractive one — started flirting with me. I ignored it at first, but when I found out my ex was bragging about how he “was in love with an older woman,” to others. I said, screw it. I slept with the friend. Not out of revenge, but because I was done being the only one holding dignity. 

He found out, freaked out, and tried to shame me. Started posting subliminals, acting heartbroken — the same man who told me I wasn’t thick enough and left me for his friend’s girl.

Then came the letters the texts, the “I’ll always love you” speeches. Out of nowhere he’s saying he never stopped loving me and wanted to see me again.

Sir. You left me for your friend’s girlfriend. Be serious.

And guess what? his new girlfriend now looks like she could be related to me. Literally. Same features, same frame. Even skinny, like me. So what was the truth?

We've had our ups and downs like every other couple but on the whole we're incredible. Or at least we were. 

I started uni in September and I got so caught up in being in a new city with new people that I admit I wasn't talking to him enough, it was a really stupid mistake and I regret it so much every day. We made up though and I thought everything was fine, we were good. If anything we were better than we had been in a long time. 

Then last night happened, I have been so scatterbrained since starting and I completely forgot that I'd agreed to continue a game with him last night that we started playing a while ago. Instead, I went out with my friends to a music spot that was doing it's final jam as it was shutting down. I told him about it and he said it was okay, he was being normal and then when I got back he just blew up at me. He was so angry and he deserves to be angry because I completely forgot. 

We were arguing most of the night. The general summary is that he feels like a broken record and I keep letting him down, which he's not wrong about. The thing that's really stuck with me is that what we've ended on right now is him saying he doesn't want to talk to me and he hasn't responded yet so I'm not sure if he means for now or if he means forever. 

I know he deserves better than the way I've been treating him but also he is the only reason I have kept going at some points. He is the only reason I pushed myself to get into this university which I love and I don't know what I'll do without him. 

And before it happens, I know some people in the comments will want to do the whole 'you're just 18, you've got your whole life ahead of you now' thing which I get but also I know he is the man I want to spend the rest of my life with and everyone I know absolutely adores him and I was so lucky to find him. 

I'm not really sure what I'm hoping to get out of this, I just feel like I can't really breathe or think and I'm hoping that getting it off my chest will help.

They just exist, they eat, sleep, wander, survive, and somehow everything stays balanced.But humans, we are always chasing something be it  money, success, validation, more and more of everything.

And when I look around, it feels like everyone is moving like robots, following a routine, not really living,but I itself don't know what real living even means. What is it that I even crave,I don't know.

Sometimes I wonder -if we evolved to be this way, to think and plan and build, why does it make us so restless and disconnected?Why do we treat the earth like it’s ours to control instead of something we’re part of?If animals can live in peace without all this overthinking, are we really 'more evolved' or just more trapped by our minds?

I want to live peacefully, maybe closer to nature, without all this pressure.
But then I feel guilty like if I stop striving, I’m wasting my potential as a human.
It’s confusing.One day I want to explore and feel everything and another day, I just want to do nothing and disappear into quiet.

Sometimes I think I like the idea of freedom and nature more than the process more like I want it to happen magically without effort.I know that sounds childish, but it’s the truth.

reddit,OffMyChest,1oqpfgf,AssumptionFrequent89,bed30e44c6b1c7c3,Feeling kinda lonely these days…,"Hey everyone. I’m a 23-year-old guy, and lately, I’ve just been feeling this deep longing for a genuine, long-term connection. Not just small talk or temporary convos, but something that actually means something.



I’ve always been more introverted—quiet, observant, deep in thought—but when I vibe with someone, I love having real conversations. Whether it’s chatting, texting, or even voice calls, I’m down if the energy clicks.



Since I was a kid, I’ve been fascinated by science and learning. I was the type to dig into topics on my own, not for grades or recognition, but out of pure curiosity. School didn’t excite me the way discovery did. I never cared much for marks or competing with others—it always felt hollow. I thought college would be different, that I’d find people who were just as driven by wonder and ideas—but most were just chasing credentials. That kind of killed the spark for me.



So I shifted my attention from subjects to people. Human behavior, emotions, thoughts, intentions—it became a whole new world to explore. I’m still on that path. I love analyzing what makes people tick, not to judge, but to understand. I want to see life in its rawest form, and experience everything fully—joy, pain, love, grief, all of it. Sometimes I feel numb, like I’m disconnected from my own emotions, and other times I feel everything all at once.



I’m not judgmental at all. I want to experience life fully—joy, pain, love, loss. Sometimes I feel emotionally numb, other times I want to feel everything, all at once. It’s weird, but maybe you get what I mean?



Last summer, I met someone here on Reddit. We connected deeply, had amazing conversations… but life happened and she drifted away. Still, that one connection showed me that it’s possible. So here I am, trying again, hoping maybe lightning strikes twice.



I’m into anime, manga, psychology, philosophy, astronomy, physics, crafting, singing, drawing, cooking… and gaming too (COD Mobile mostly, but open to new stuff). I’m also writing a book—it’s my way of making sense of this strange world.



I think a lot about life, meaning, existence (yup, existential crisis mode, often). I guess I’m just searching for someone who sees life the way I do—or at least tries to. Someone rational. Someone who isn’t distracted by the usual noise, but who’s trying to actually live life. Someone who could maybe help me enjoy it more—and I’d do the same in return.



I’d really love to find a female friend, if I’m being honest. It’s not just about gender—there’s something about that emotional balance that feels right for me. In my experience, male friendships often fade away with time—marriage, responsibilities, you know the drill. But with a female friend, I feel like there’s more potential for something deeper and lasting. Maybe even something more. Who knows?



I’m an INTP. My favorite movie is Into the Wild. I don’t really like kids (just being honest), but pets are great. I don’t believe in marriage—I feel like it’s more of a social construct than a true bond. I’ve seen how it can drain the essence out of real friendship and connection.



More than anything, I’m just looking for someone who’s thoughtful, clear-minded, and curious. Someone who’s not afraid of the quiet, who’s okay with my overthinking, my silences, and my random bursts of deep thoughts. I know I’m not easy to handle sometimes, but I have a lot of heart to give when someone really sees me.



So yeah… if any of this resonates with you, message me. Maybe you’ve been feeling the same way too. Maybe we can share this weird, beautiful, sometimes heavy inner world together. And maybe, just maybe, we’ll find something rare.",2,0,2025-11-07T08:56:10+00:00,https://reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/1oqpfgf/feeling_kinda_lonely_these_days/,Positive
reddit,OffMyChest,1oqn2pb,Speck_of_dust-,fc0e0a69e3078279,I don’t want to accept gifts from my aunt anymore because they trigger me emotionally.,"I (35F) don’t want to receive gifts from my aunt anymore, even small ones. They are emotional triggers for me, and I’m finally realizing why.

My aunt has never really seen me for who I am. Since I was a kid, she has seen me as arrogant, like I thought I was better than her son (my cousin). That idea was completely false, but it stuck for decades.

Her son, who is manipulative and cruel, humiliated me more than once and even kicked me out of their house. I loved my aunt deeply, but when that happened, she took his side without even listening to my side of the story. I lost her, and it broke something in me.

Since then, every time she sends me a gift, even something small, I feel sick. It doesn’t feel kind. It feels like emotional bait, like she’s trying to erase the past with a gesture that costs her nothing. She never acknowledged what happened, never wanted to talk about it, never cared to understand how much it hurt me.

The gifts feel like a fake peace treaty signed by only one side. They reopen the wound every time.

I don’t want to be rude or cold, but I’m at the point where I want to tell her directly: “Please don’t send me anything else. What I need isn’t gifts. It’s honesty and accountability.”

But I’m scared it will sound harsh or like I’m overreacting. Has anyone here ever felt this way? Is it fair to refuse gifts when they come from someone who refuses to face what they’ve done?

I just don’t want to pretend we’re okay anymore.

I was in a relationship I didn’t want to be in and my dad told me to just accept it and submit to him. He gave the guy 10 grand to buy a house under his name. My dad gave each of his kids 10 grand towards something in their adult life. I told him I didn’t want to use it yet since the guy was being coercive and sort of forcing his way into my life. Anyway, he didn’t listen and the guy ended up being wicked abusive and took everything from me. I felt I had no where to go since my dad told me to never ask him for help after he gave me the 10 grand. The kicker? I had cancer and was moving to get treatment and that’s why he wanted to make me buy a house. I was 30 years old. Anyway, the guy put his hands on me and i was 800 miles away from anyone. And when he left the house. I just got up and walked out the door. Left everything because I knew once it was physical I was in danger. It’s been 8 years later and it’s been so difficult to rebuild from absolutely nothing. It felt like my dad sold me to someone I told him I didn’t want to bE with. But since I had cancer at the time, I was so powerless and scared. When I needed him the most he pushed me aside. When I needed his protection he fed me to someone I told him wasn’t good. And he dismissed me completely.

Anyway. I also found out he cheated on my mom and was buying prostitutes during the time I had cancer. So it made it even worse. like he was projecting some weird shit onto me by making me go through with something I was clearly uncomfortable worh. The guy was 30 years older than me which was my dad’s age so it was strange he even condoned it. But he acted like he was his best friend. And I have so many questions that will never be answered. 

I’m trying to have a forgiving heart. I’m trying to remember him how he was before all this but I’m so angry at him. I just imagine myself going to his grave and screaming at him. 

I’m still wicked broke. I’m trying my best and making ends meet but some days it’s difficult not to think about the fact that someone took (ended up being 50k) so much from me when I was so vulnerable and my dad basically help hand it over to him. I just don’t understand why he did that. I have very little joy. I’m constantly stressed about money and I still am sick a lot from the aftermath of cancer. If I didn’t have children, I’d def not be here. I put on a happy face for them and I know I’m so lucky to have a family of my own. They’re so perfect. but inside, my mind is constantly racing and my heart beats so fast with constant anxiety. I just want one day. One day to rest and breathe and have a break. I just want to lay in bed and cry and eat snacks all day. Maybe watch a movie. I’m so tired. I worked so hard my whole life. I just want a tiny respite.

We were waiting at the checkout when an old lady in front of us was paying. She only had a few basic things, some bread and a few vegetables.

Then a security guard came over. They had seen on the camera that she had put a few items in her bag without scanning them, a pack of ham, some cheese, and sausages. They stopped her at the register and asked her to pay for them. She looked really embarrassed and tried to explain that she forgot, but it was clear she didn’t have enough money.

We were right behind her, so we heard everything. Something in me just couldn’t watch it happen. Before it turned into a scene, I stepped forward and paid for the items.

The guard nodded, the old lady looked at me with tears in her eyes and quietly said, “Thank you.”

My girlfriend, on the other hand, was furious. She said things like “It’s not your business,” “You don’t know how many times she’s done this,” and “You’re just encouraging her to steal.” But I couldn’t see it that way. I don’t know what led her to risk stealing a bit of food, but I didn’t want her to be humiliated.

I don’t know if I did the right thing or if I really was the idiot here, but that night I couldn’t stop thinking that maybe those few dollars meant everything to someone.

Things have felt weird between my girlfriend and me since it happened.

reddit,OffMyChest,1oqnq4j,Legitimate-Novel-558,eb58692f80945531,I am going to be nicer to my sister!,"My twin sister (20F) is the coolest person in the world. We have such different personalities but we're into the same bands and shows and we're huge nerds about what we're into. Its amazing having a friend all the time that you can make niche reference with. She's also my creative partner and I wouldn't want to work with anyone else. She understands me so well and anytime we think of a scene for a comic or animation we're working on, I know for certain she's imagining everything the exact same way I am, down to the finest detail. We're in sync all the time.

Unfortunately, I haven't been the best to her. We both grew up in a happy but tumultuous home. We've been raised by a single mother with severe anxiety and chronic illness, and we've been mostly kept away from our narcissistic dad. Because of the inconsistency in our parenting I've been very hard on her at times, forcing her to be a stable support figure because I also needed someone to be strong for me. We have had to care for our mum when she's sick and I know this deeply affected her. I should have been more attentive to how traumatic these situations could have been for her, and been the support she desperately needed..

I've noticed this treatment has definitely impacted her in her later life. She often believes she's a problem in the family and that she's too emotional, and I know thats partially my fault. It deeply saddens me that I've made my sister feel that way when every day she's been so loving and understanding to me.

I've apologised relentlessly and worked on myself, and am commitied to being the sister she needs. I'm not always perfect; I'm prone to bad anxiety-ridden outbursts that make me act nasty, but I always rush to apologise and be better when I have the ability to. She totally forgives me for everything as well, which kinda makes me even sadder. She's still so cool and lovely and STILL comes to me for advice despite it all. And she still considers me her best friend.

I will be a nicer sister. She deserves the best sister in the world.",2,0,2025-11-07T07:05:31+00:00,https://reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/1oqnq4j/i_am_going_to_be_nicer_to_my_sister/,Positive
reddit,OffMyChest,1oqlcce,Existing_Holiday_,dd7c67b60dab6d34,my father broke my heart,"it’s strange how someone can hurt you so deeply without ever laying a hand on you.  
for the longest time, i thought my dad was strict but loving, someone who cared, said he loves me, i'm most imp. but now, i don’t think that’s true anymore.

recently, he said things that completely changed how i see him. all because i disagreed with him. i wasn’t rude, i wasn’t shouting, i just gave my point of view. and for that, i was told i’m “nothing,” “a waste,” that my words don’t matter, that it’s his *mercy* to even listen to me. he said i have to live by his terms because it’s *his* house.

i stood there trying to explain i wasn’t arguing, just talking. but he kept going, trying to break me down like he wanted me to realize how powerless i am. and maybe that’s what broke me most realizing that the man i thought understood me only values me when i’m silent.

the next morning, he acted like nothing happened. laughing, making jokes, pretending all was fine. but something shifted in me. i can’t unhear what he said. i can’t look at him the same way. even his affection feels fake now, like it’s just part of the same control.

i thought he was different. i loved him the most. i wanted a partner like him, i wanted to be like him. but not anymore.

people always talk about heartbreak from love, but nobody talks about when a parent breaks your heart. when you finally see their real side the ego, the need to dominate, the lack of empathy and you realize the love you trusted had conditions.

i wish he knew that his words did more damage than he’ll ever admit. i wish he knew i’m not angry, i’m just hurt. because i’ve seen the real him now, and i don’t think i can ever go back to seeing him the same way again.",3,0,2025-11-07T04:48:46+00:00,https://reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/1oqlcce/my_father_broke_my_heart/,Negative
reddit,OffMyChest,1oqnejq,AgileObject2371,e2db39891f3408c9,Lying about the fact that I had smoked to my girlfriend,"Me (28M) and my girlfriend (30F) have recently rekindled our relationship after a couple of months separated. It was going absolutely amazingly and we both felt like we were on the same page and she felt like she felt understood after a few things that have happened to cause the initial break up. 

I have a had a very difficult time in my past with being addicted to nicotine and had smoked for the best part of 7 years. Through countless attempts and mental breakdowns over feeing like I could never get out of it, I finally quit 2 years before meeting my girlfriend.

We’ve had an excellent relationship and get along extremely well. We both felt on the same page about a lot of things and adored each others company and love each other very much. 

We have had some issues here and there that took a bit of time and effort to get past, but we managed to and things were going well. 

Due to some worries about how much I was working at the time and a few other things, she decided to end things. I was distraught and it caused me to relapse smoking again. 

We managed to work things out and decide to keep going and throughout that I had struggled to stop smoking. I had managed to stop for weeks at a time, however a larger issue has come from that. Every time I had smoked I feel a huge amount of shame and regret and I now realise I am extremely hard on myself about it and I lie to myself and pretend I’m on top of it. 

Three seperate times she has smelt it on my breath and asked if I had smoked. Each time I regrettably lied about the fact that I hadn’t impulsively and each time ended up admitting to it after her getting it out of me. This has (fairly) caused significant issues for her about me and this relationship. The 3rd time I panicked to the point that I tried to convince her that I hadn’t smoked by trying to show her bank transactions. Causing her to decide we can’t be together. 

After a couple of months on working on myself and working on other issues that have been apparent, we decided to try again. This time everything went so well and we both felt amazing about the relationship again and I truly believed I was on top of this and that we had worked through the issues that I had brought out and were much stronger for it. 

We had a bit of a disagreement one night and I caved to cigarettes again. This time I did manage to only have 1 before throwing the packet away. 

4 days later we caught up as normal and she asked how the smoking was going and I said it was going fine. She then said she smelt it on my breath and I impulsively lied about it again. Once again due to panic I tried for a while to convince her that I hadn’t smoked and kept the lie going for a few hours and into the next day. Even after he asking me again a couple of times if I was sure I hadn’t smoked. To which I had said I was sure. 

On my way home it all hit me and I called her and admitted to it. Even then it took me a bit to tell the full truth that I had smoked.

I’m generally not someone who lies and I do consider myself an honest person for the most part. However when it comes to smoking and the fact that I had or not, I find I just panic and impulsively go into denying it. 

I’m now seeking therapy for it and trying to do the best I can to overcome this issue and understand where it comes from. I’ve kept off the cigarettes and am making a huge effort to make sure that I never go back because they have ruined my life. 

I don’t think she will forgive me this time, but it’s so painful knowing that I have hurt someone who means the world to me and someone who I loved dearly and saw a future with. I am not coping and struggling with the fact that I have not only betrayed her and broken her trust. I have multiple times. She was more than patient (too patient) and I had a second chance that I blew again due to this. 

I don’t know how to cope with the guilt and shame that I have knowing that I did this to someone I care about. I know in myself that I’m capable of being honest and that it seems to be a fairly isolated situation surrounding smoking. But I ruined the one thing that means the world to me. 

I am so deeply and incredibly sorry my love.

One of the biggest cons was my lack of confidence, especially around customers. He said he’d listened in on one of my conversations and told me I sounded “really awkward.” What he doesn’t understand is that knowing he was listening made my anxiety skyrocket. I was already feeling stressed, but I stayed composed. Maybe I stumbled a bit, but I honestly didn’t think it was that bad.

I’ve struggled with social anxiety my whole life. And I really thought I was getting better. I thought I was good at masking it but apparently not.

Since I started, he’s constantly told me I “need to be more confident.” But confidence isn’t something I can just switch on. And hearing that over and over has chipped away at the little bit I did have. I actually feel like I’ve gotten worse because of it.

This job has been a huge source of stress. I’ve been reminded about my probation constantly, and made to feel like I’m a bad worker. I’ve made maybe five mistakes in three months, and every single one turned into a half hour talk that left me feeling small. I’ve also been blamed for things I didn’t do. Just today, my boss snapped at me saying, “This is what I meant during the review” because I didn’t have all the details about the products for a client. But I wasn’t even the one who dealt with it and my coworker hadn’t passed on the full info.

He told me how he and my coworker talked behind my back, that the person they hired at the interview is completely different to what they got. Which really hurt my feelings as I wasn’t any different to how I usually am.

I’m trying so hard. But I’m exhausted. I feel like I’m constantly being watched and judged, and it’s making my anxiety spiral. I don’t know how to keep pretending I’m okay when I feel like I’m falling apart inside.

If anyone else has been through something similar, I’d really appreciate hearing from you. I just need a bit of kindness right now.",11,8,2025-11-06T21:48:47+00:00,https://reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/1oqc264/my_boss_gave_me_a_pros_and_cons_list_of_me_as_a/,Negative

To add fuel to this, I found out I was pregnant weeks after we booked the trip. Anyhow, we settled for an all-inclusive resort in Egypt for 7 nights.

I spent £800 on this trip, and my friend £500 as this was her budget.

We arrived late Sunday evening. On Tuesday, my friend started to feel unwell and we called a doctor to the hotel. By Wednesday morning, my friend was admitted to the hospital.

I’m typing this still in the hospital. Our hotel is a 40 minute drive away and I’ve been getting taxi’s back and fourth collecting things. The hospital’s breakfast and dinner is merely crackers, bread and yoghurt and I’m fkin starving being pregnant. I’m nauseous and vomiting and yet having to take care of my poorly friend.

I feel so salty and sad that the holiday I’ve been craving for so long was the opposite of relaxation. Instead, I feel like I’ve spent £800 just to run around and look after my poorly friend whilst I’m sick myself with nausea and exhaustion. I’ve been staying with my friend in the hospital since 6AM on Wednesday and hopefully will be discharged tomorrow. Our scheduled flight home is Sunday. So much for a holiday.

reddit,OffMyChest,1oqh45m,augustsippedaway777,eb1f074522367fc5,My boyfriend’s sister might be obsessed with him.,"I need some advice on my future in-law situation. (Fake Names) 
My boyfriend and I just celebrated our 4 year anniversary (he’s M23, we will call him Dev, I’m F22). We’ve talked about marriage and we’re getting to the time where we want to think about moving out and starting our adult lives and our professional careers. Long story short, we’re in a serious long term relationship. 
As a quick backstory, he didn’t have a great childhood. His parents are immigrants and quite traditional, they have suffered war and don’t speak a lot of English. When he was a kid, his twin sister was diagnosed with cancer and underwent multiple surgeries and treatments. We will call her Aveena. Her illness affected their family a lot and HEAVILY impacted the way they raised the two. Dev suffered abuse from parents and felt guilt all the time. Aveena was given most of the attention due to her illness and still is treated as if she is a child by her parents. 
Today, Dev is outgoing and personable and makes friends easily. Aveena is shy and reserved and does not do much outside the house unless she’s with her mom. 

When Dev and I started dating, his family never really got to know me or made an effort to. I don’t think they considered our relationship to be “serious” and were more reserved with their words. Aveena never really made conversation with me. I thought either she’s just shy or she didn’t want to talk to me. We had some conversation here and there but not the way I would with my sisters. 
Throughout the first year of our relationship, Dev invited Aveena to a lot of the things we would do as a couple including plans we intended as dates— to which I never said no to. A year-ish into our relationship, Dev mentioned a conversation he was told between his mom and Aveena. Aveena told their mom that she felt like I was “stealing” her brother from her. I kind of brushed this off. Since I started paying more into conversations and instances like these, it’s gotten worse. 
I let Dev borrow my iPad at one point and he mentioned that Aveena was using it. After I got it back, out of curiosity I checked the screen time and found that there was ten minutes of usage on iMessage during the time she was using it— which kind of confirms she was looking through my messages? And I’ve since found out she looks at our messages on Dev’s laptop too. 
One time, she got her nails done and said that she got the colour green because Dev said he liked the colour green. 
Another time, Dev included me in plans with their godsisters and she texted him privately and said “I thought you and I were just supposed to be hanging out today”. 
She’s also actually cried at one point when I slept over at their house. And she’s also cried when Dev can’t attend events or hangouts. 
It’s just really weird vibes and I don’t know what to do. DO I do anything? I get along great with his older sister and cousins and even his mom now. It always feels like there’s some sort of envy or jealousy. I can’t confront her or have a conversation because she gets like upset with confrontation and I’m afraid she’ll cry about it. 
I really love Dev. And obviously I want his family to like me but what am I supposed to do if this family / sibling dynamic is so ingrained in them. Will the problem solve itself when we move out and she doesn’t have him to rely on?

reddit,OffMyChest,1oqmr83,BananaChipsOP,bb7284c89f12bc4a,My mom treats me like I’m her biggest mistake just because I have alopecia,"I just want to tell my sadness here. Nothing much, it’s just what my mom is doing to me it’s so unfair. She hates me because I have alopecia. Is it my fault.She always says she didn’t want me, that I was born only because my dad’s parents wanted to see a grandchild. She always says I’m a mistake and waste of money but we are upper middle class family 
During my whole life,if I scored even 2 or 3 marks less, she would beat me badly. I thought it was normal in Indian households. Even if I didn’t perform well, I did my best. I scored full A+ in 10th and 12th, and I graduated college with distinction. But when I tell her I did it, she says,“It’s because of her motivation my mom's motivation is telling if idont score much I'm shame to the everyone and don't forget u are born with disability and if u don't score well nobody wants u ,,these words still rings in my ear then she'll be like 
there are so many families who never look after their children she says I should be proud that she’s having me and doing everything for me. But all I wanted was for her to say, “You did well.” That never happened in my life.
Even now, in my 20 years of life, I can’t ask for new clothes when everyone else is buying in my home my parents says ,Your money is spent on your medical expenses. It hurts cuz I was a child at that tym then i says we can stop the medications and buy things my parents will be like  will u  wear your clothes on ur head Your head make us more ashamed.” Somehow, they have money to spend on so many poojas and pandits, but not on me.saying now I'm questioning them that means someone is influencing me and have to do some Pooja's 

Whenever I eat something, she humiliates me, saying I’m overweight (I’m not)I'm 5'3 and 54 kg. She says, “When I was your age, I used to eat a lot less and was more feminine than u than ur athletic male body and also I have broad shoulders But in front of my father, she acts differently  she says she’s worried I’m  eating less to become a model. She acts like a completely different person in front of relatives and friends, always kind, perfect, and giving.
If people saw her at home, they would never believe it

What I can never accept is that she always curses me, saying I won’t be anything in life, that I’ll always stay in this house, and that all my studying will be wasted. She puts food for everyone except me. My dad won’t stand up for me, because if he does, she threatens to stop doing anything at home or won't look after my siblings or won't go to work . Whenever my parents fight, she takes all the anger out on me, saying every problem started because of my birth. Then she ignores me completely, while showering love on my siblings.
You might think I don’t do anything at home, but I do all the chores  cooking, cleaning, everything Even my younger siblings get scolded less because they are boys and also they will be the one looking after my parents in their elder days . She says, “Younger ones study by looking at their elder sibling ” and then scolds me even when it’s not my fault.

Now I realize why I’m not a bubbly character. Whenever I talk or smile, she says it’s “to seduce boys.” She checks my phone daily, my gallery, everything. Because of this, I’ve become a perfect liar. I hide things. I don’t even know how to open up to anyone. I even flinch if someone raises their hand.
I’ve started hating myself because of the constant body shaming. Whenever I wear sleeveless clothes, she says I look masculine. I’m athletic, but she hates it. She says I’m not feminine enough and mocks my body.

I’m depressed. I don’t even know how to smile properly anymore. The funny thing is, I’m jealous of my siblings. They don’t have to do anything. I’ve had to take care of myself in everything since I was 12 sometimes i think i shouldn't have been born 

Even now, while I’m typing this, my mom isn’t talking to me

I was out drinking last month with friends and made a comment like “oh I wish someone had kissed me” and my friend leaned in and pecked me. Later we were partying and I don’t remember how she looked—ik when she’s drunk she goes out and compliments women drunkenly, kisses them, dances wildly, etc. so she might’ve been doing that? Like maybe I saw her stumbling around and saying weird stuff, like stuff u see when drunk, but truth is that bc it’s been a month I don’t really remember. I might 

I see her again at the next party and said “oh remember when we kissed?” and she leaned in and kissed me again. Our friends were like oh! and pulled us apart. i do have a photo taken after that and she’s upright and smiling, which idk if that means anything. I did see her kissing more people later. To be clear, at this point, I was dizzy and stuff but mentally I still had a decent amount of awareness, so it’s not like I was utterly wasted or even close, though I did become more like that way later. 

I asked her roommate abt it the next day out of curiosity, and I was like “was she drunk”, and she was like yeah very drunk and I became worried and asked if the kiss was okay, and she was like oh yeah she kisses a lot, she made out with more people once you left. I also asked the girl herself and she was like oh I don’t really remember that but it’s all good! 

Then I asked her about it again a week later and she said don’t worry about it, I don’t think abt it at all, I kiss girls a lot when drunk, it was consensual. So I am pretty sure she’s not hurt, and I might be overthinking this?

Issue is I think I must’ve seen her acting drunk and wild, forgot about it, kissed her, and now she can’t even remember it. I can’t remember rn, but I know how she acts when drunk, and on the way to the next party, I MUST have seen some sign of her acting that way—like doing stupid stuff, however drunk people look. And then I forgot about it when it came time to kissing her again; like I truly wasn’t thinking too deeply and just wanted to kiss her. On top of that, I keep seeing people online saying blackouts aren’t consent. Meaning since she forgot about it, she must not have had the ability to consent at the time.

I feel really shitty.  But is this a pretty normal messy drink situation? ",1,0,2025-11-07T09:37:32+00:00,https://reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/1oqq35x/i_feel_like_i_violated_my_friend_when_we_were/,Negative
reddit,OffMyChest,1oqmgvr,JaySonOrThotDaughtr,8268f9cc7b16b552,Co worker affair M19 and F36,"Obvious throwaway for privacy

This happened yesterday and my mind is still racing. Part of me is excited that it happened but I'm also scared that it may cause issues in the near/further future.

For context ive been working at a sports stadium since the start of the year. I'm in the corporate team so there's 4 of us that set all the bars and lounges for event days. My team consists of F55, M29 and F51 plus myself. The M29 is our supervisor yet he's the next closest in age to me out of all the other office fulltime staff. The F36 that this is about is the corporate suites manager, so she looks after the suites and high profile clients and since we also come under the corporate space, we will sometimes help her set up her rooms so we are often around eachtother. I  was told early on that she was ""the office flirt"", she'd dress in tight, revealing clothing yet still businessy that it wouldn't get in trouble with HR. She'd tell you all these dirty jokes and basically tried to be the hottest person in the room. 
She's married and has a 5yo son at home.

Honestly I think she's like 4/10 in the face and her body is maybe a 6/10 so I've never been attracted to her. The only thing that catches my eye is her booty, 10/10. Early on in my career there, there were rumors she was hooking up with our beverage supervisor. They'd dissappear for lunch together and return an hour later when we only get 30min breaks. Now I'd be lying if my 19yo mind hadn't fantasized what it'd be like to hookup with her but never in a million years did I think I'd get that chance.

This week was slow for us. We've already pretty much set up what we needed so we were all working alongside eachother taking it slow. On Tuesday she was paired with me to help me set up the players area which is the space I run on event days. This was our first time working together alone so I was forced to make convo with her. After an awkward first 10 minutes she quickly started up the flirting saying how I'm a handsome young fit man blah blah a girls dream to work with alone. It fueled my ego a lot at the time but I knew she'd say that about anyone. By the end of it we were telling eachother about our love lives, sex stories and losing virginities etc.
Nothing happened that day.

Yesterday, Thursday however we were paired up again but this time by her request to help her finish off some beverage stuff in her suites. She convinced my manager that some last minute changes had happened and she needed my muscles to help move the beverage trolleys. Being a quiet day my manager agreed. Upon making our way up to the first suite she said there wasn't any work and just thought I'd be fun to chill out together and do nothing for an hour or so. I wasn't going to complain since my team usually are on smoko for ages so I get heaps of time to scroll my phone.

We were just chilling on the couch and our convo soon picked up from the Tuesday and eventually led to her asking me if I found her attractive. I was caught off guard and obviously blushed and she giggled. From there things happened, it started with kissing which already had my heart racing, then progressed to her getting on top of me. It started sensual but around the 5 minute mark turned to aggressive backshots. It lasted maybe 20 minutes before we cleaned ourselves up and took some time to cool down. 

I don't know if I feel like I was preyed upon or if I actually wanted it to happen too. The rest of that day and all of today she didn't say much to me, she winked and smiled a few times but the flirting and dirty talk stopped pretty much after that. Did I enjoy it? Yes. But I still feel guilty for her family and am scared about if this somehow gets out to the rest of the office group. It's now Friday evening so I won't see her until Monday. In the mean time my mind is just racing constantly replaying the moment.",3,3,2025-11-07T05:51:03+00:00,https://reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/1oqmgvr/co_worker_affair_m19_and_f36/,Positive

This guy was super nice at the beginning, he trained me. We are both around the same age so we got along, ex frat but not in a super douchey way. He’s just doing too much. 

There’s a word for it, but essentially it’s like I’m constantly being policed by every little thing I say. He’s always talking about politics and I never bring up my opinions because I know he’d condemn me for them. He overthinks, nags and makes sure to come and visit me every day. He’s always fidgeting with something…breaks it or hurts himself. He waits in his car when I get to work so he can walk in with me. I try to get there first so I don’t have to talk to him. He follows me to my locker when I leave so he can walk out with me. Cringe. Train wreck. Tf are you doing dude?

Like fuck off, not interested. Idk if he’s nervous or flirting but seriously? 

I know I’ve given him the wrong impression because I’m always very nice. I make people laugh, I try to make the workplace fun because that’s really what it’s all about. Textbook people pleaser, don’t want to rock the boat. None of the other people I’m close to at work bother me like this. I always try to be pleasant around others especially in a work environment. I’d say it’s essential, especially when working in team settings. 

So now, he thinks we’re just fuckin besties when I want to rip my hair out every time I have to have a conversation. Half the time he comes in I’m just trying to work, ordinarily this wouldn’t matter if he was someone I liked. 

He also has a gf, I have a BF. I told my BF ab this guy and how he’s just annoying as fuck, he just agrees and probably hates that I have to put up with it. 

I don’t feel “harassed”, simply put we just don’t mesh as people. I have to fake it, that’s not a sustainable friendship. My other buddy at work is like me, also doesn’t get along with this guy because he’s an insufferable op. This will probably die here, just had to articulate it.

Starting school year I was called a genius as I kept getting high grades, my classmates loved being with me, and they would even fight over to have me in their group because to them I seemed like the ""smart pants"" 

However in Term 2, I got off the wrong foot and befriended a guy who was toxic/harassed/ and gave me death threats ( which was later on resolved by the school guidance)  It was never the same after that, people started avoiding me and I've been alone ever since, no one even wants to sit beside me (as in the first row is completely empty but me).

They knew about what happened and how our classmate (the guy) was the one who gave me death threats but why am I the one who's being ignored? 

I tried my best to shrug it off and to continue doing well in class and to maintain my high grades but I never felt the same. Back then I would be excited to go to school and talk to people, but now I'd rather just go straight home because it's been draining me. 

All my classmates have their own friendgroup except from me. I've been okay with being alone but recently we had a research group and our professor told us to choose our own groups. I was expecting my old research group (where I did well in and contributed more than the rest) would choose me as their member but seeing them all teaming up without me in the group list while I was there without anyone asking me to be in their group just left me speechless.

reddit,OffMyChest,1oqojdt,aesth-8,771363d0c314ed6d,"I can’t tell if I’m in love, just lonely, or completely losing it","Hey Reddit,

I’m going through a lot right now. I *should* probably be in therapy, but I can’t afford that yet, so I’m hoping to get some perspective here instead.

Two months ago, I broke up with my boyfriend of a year and a half. It was long distance, we both handled it maturely, no drama, just didn’t work out. Still—he was my first real relationship, the person I thought I’d introduce to my parents, so it hurt like hell.

Around that time, this guy friend—someone who was more of an acquaintance before—suddenly became really close to me. We started running into each other a lot, talking more, and he ended up being my emotional crutch through the breakup. Late-night ice cream runs, long texts, comforting me when I cried… you name it.

He shared a lot about his own life too—stuff he said he doesn’t usually talk about. There were little hints that maybe he liked me (the way he’d hug me, subtle flirting, deep compatibility questions), but I told myself I was probably just broken and reading too much into it.

Then one night after a party, he dropped me home and had to stay because of work stuff that went really late. I offered him to crash at my place since he looked exhausted. Only problem—I have a small twin bed. We both slept on it. And yeah, things got *intense*. We cuddled. Nothing more, but it definitely crossed a line emotionally. Worst thing: stuff ALMOST happened, but never really did.

The next morning we talked, and he admitted he *had* thought about us. But then said something like, “You’re amazing, but my family wouldn’t agree.” I saw this coming but wasn't sure if he would resist his family. We acknowledged the attraction and I don’t remember clearly how or what exactly was said, but somehow decided to stay friends. 

It’s been about a month since that night and I’m still all over the place.

Here’s the mess in my head right now:

1. I can’t stop thinking about how good we are together. So compatible. We both have exactly what we both are looking for. Except for one difference, a major one at that, his family PROBABLY won't agree. But he isn't even willing to have that conversation with them again. It has happened to him in the past too. Too painful for him.
2. I don’t know if I actually like him, or if I’m just starved for comfort and attention after my breakup.
3. I can’t imagine not having him in my life at all. I am dead stubborn that I need him around, no matter what. We will be friends AT LEAST. We also have a lot of mutual friends that will be screwed over if this blows up.
4. He’s already talking to other women (that his family approves of), and I don’t want to be that selfish person who ruins his chances at something real.

But the truth? I miss him. I want to kiss him. I miss his hugs. I even had a dream about him last night and woke up missing the warmth.

I feel stuck between wanting to move on and wanting him so badly it hurts.  
How do I get over this agony? It is so exhausting.

**TL;DR:** Broke up with my long-term boyfriend, got close to a guy friend who helped me through it, emotional tension turned into a half-cuddly night, he admitted feelings but said it wouldn’t work because of family.

reddit,OffMyChest,1oqohly,Express-Bee-8429,93ef33e355cb55d1,(F21) A guy I harshly rejected in high school SAd me recently.,"This happened about 3 months ago. I haven’t told this story to anyone but my close friends, I never even reported it.

I was a bit of a mean girl in high school. This one guy, we’ll call him J, had a thing for me… but because he was unpopular, and 16yo me was stuck up, I was unnecessarily rude to him. When he would text me on Insta I’d ss his messages and send them to my groupchat to laugh at. When he’d approach me at school, I’d laugh at him and walk away. He still didn’t get the hint and he asked me out in front of my friends, and I rejected him pretty harshly, and told him to leave me alone. And he did. He didn’t approach me or try to message me again, and he seemed like he was unaffected by the whole thing. I felt awful about it by this point, but I never tried reaching out to apologise, I still had too much pride. 

We had nothing to do with each other until recently, almost 5 years later, when we ended up at the same house party as each other in our home town. When I saw J, I was pretty fucked up, but I’d only been drinking and smoking. I froze when we made eye contact but he acted so nonchalant, like nothing ever happened. He gave me a warm greeting, almost as if he was actually happy to see me. After catching up for a few minutes, I asked if we could talk somewhere private. He seemed confused but took me to one of the bedrooms. We sat on the edge of the bed and I just started crying, I wasn’t sober and he brought up a lot of guilt, I couldn’t keep it in.

I told him how sorry I was about how I treated him, and how I’d felt terrible about it for years. But he was kind and told me he hadn’t even thought about it in years. After a minute of comforting me, he told me it was time to cheer up and go back to the party. He pulled out a bag of what he told me was coke and gave me 2 *big* bumps, and he had one small one. We sat there for a few minutes as I thanked him and apologised again, before I felt the drip of the “coke” down my throat, and I knew immediately it was actually ket. I’d only done ket once before, and much less, and hated it.

As soon as I tasted it I looked at him, really confused. I was kinda in disbelief so I laughed and said “it tastes like ket, it’s not is it?”, but he just laughed and pushed me on the bed. I panicked. I could still move perfectly fine at that moment so I tried to fight back, he covered my mouth so I couldn’t scream but I was still using my arms and legs to make it as hard as I could for him, but I’m 5’0 and he’s at least 6’2 and muscular, I had no chance. I wasn’t wearing any underwear under my dress because the dress was tight and I didn’t want the panty seams to show, a choice I regretted so much in that moment.

It all happened so quick. He took his pants off and wasted no time forcing it inside me. He was big, and it hurt, he could barely get it in. At this point I was almost k-holing and I could barely move. I was crying but I gave up on screaming, or fighting back. I was so high. He kept telling me I deserved it, he kept choking me, he kept hitting me and spitting at me. He called me an “uptight b” and just kept repeating over and over that I had it coming, that I deserved it. I was sobbing, but eventually in my head, I was telling myself I deserved it too. I felt the lowest I’d ever felt in my life. Then he finished inside me, told me that if I told anyone then he’d kill me, and left me there. I still couldn’t move, both from shock and the ket.

This still feels so recent despite happening months ago. I don’t think I’m actually processing everything properly, lol.",1,0,2025-11-07T07:55:03+00:00,https://reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/1oqohly/f21_a_guy_i_harshly_rejected_in_high_school_sad/,Negative

i love my boyfriend so much. we have been together for almost 4 years and were friends for 2 years before that. the beginning was a fairytale. we moved in together and had fun playing house for a while. i got sick in September 2022 and was put into an induced coma. he texted me every day, and he visited every day. when i woke up 8 days later he stayed with me through all visiting ours and would facetime me all night. when i finally came home he made sure the place was spotless and i had my comfort meal. simplicities, maybe nothing i should even be grateful for but i am. i felt so loved. i dont know what has happened. he has had problems with porn addiction in the past but it's not even where the issues stand now. he has anger issues, horrible ones. he doesn't drive and he doesn't even think it's a problem anymore. i ""nag"" about it and he says he will get to it, but when i become angry he threatens how it's my financial responsibility to take him to work. it helps us. we just moved to a bigger place and we thought it would be an awesome time together, just us two. he became enraged at everything i did, i didn't pack the car right or i'm not gentle enough with the glassware. he'll cuss me out, tell me i'm stupid (he says it's the thing i'm doing or saying that's stupid, not me"". ) now that we have moved he said he was going to calm down, he can finally relax. it's been stressful i understand. now he gets mad watching me play games. he gets mad when i try to talk to him after a fight. he threatens to leave me and then forgives me the next morning without ever apologizing himself. he blames me for every issue in his life and i know it's not my fault, i know i deserve more. i just dont want him to leave. the man that loved a dying version of me, i never knew he would become this man. i deserve this. thanks for reading if you did. he's angry with me right now and i can't face another lonely night of projecting blame onto myself.

reddit,OffMyChest,1oqfrae,DamnGina530,c5a8b7ab2870cbe1,I FINALLY got PROOF,"Sorry... it's a little long. But I had to get it out.

So I (52f) have been suspecting my bf (40m) was cheating. At least talking to another female and having phone sex. I've seen him and heard him as well as the female. But he tells me I'm hearing things... It's all in my head... I'm crazy.. blah, blah, blah! 

This has been going on for about two and a half years. I hear him allllll the time like whenever I leave the room, when he goes to a different room, when he leaves the house (I'll explain later) and even right in bed next me. He adamantly denies it all. 

So I set up voice recorders and there were definitely whispered conversations recorded.. Of course,  he claimed he heard nothing on them and I was just hearing things. Hed argue: ""I'm not that kind of person""... ""I can't believe you think I would do something like that"".. ""you're attacking my character."" A BUNCH OF CRAP! And surprise! Surprise! My recordings kept disappearing. And the recording devices stopped working or they would go missing.

He very well knows I can hear them. He knows I know he's lying. He has an excuse for EVERYTHING! So I really started paying close attention to his behaviors. He always seemed to be acting suspicious. I compared his baseline behaviors to when I'd question him. He gets angry. He deflects.Hed give me passwords but they wouldn't work. He's turn his location off so I couldn't see him on FIND MY DEVICE. All of it pointed to him being in another relationship. But he will not admit ANYTHING! 

Then last night, he left his laptop open, and there it was. I guess he forgot he put up a security camera because he got my proof for me! There were videos of him proving #1- he has a secret phone #2- he was talking with her on it (while holding his normal phone in his other hand- there's no denying it- plus it's a different color) and #3- he was having a sexual conversation with her when he locked himself in the bathroom, after making sure I was asleep

I could never figure out HOW he was talking to her because I've never found a phone. I think it was some kind of microphone. Something very small that he hide easily. And she always sounds like she's on speaker or something. The weird thing is is that when he'd leave the house I could totally hear him and her talking in the spare room. I searched like crazy but could never find anything. And usually, within minutes of him leaving, I could hear them having sex. Then it hit me- it's my freaking neighbor!

And so now I'm currently waiting for him to come home. I know he's still going to try to deny it but, I took screenshots of the videos so I can prove ""my proof."" . I'm so angry at what he's put me through instead of just being adult enough to say ""I met someone else"" but, no he intentionally hurt me, saw my tears, watched me fall apart and let me think I was having mental health problems instead of being honest with me. 

He was next door! He's been carrying on with my  freaking neighbor! That's why I can hear him so well because these walls are paper thin! I've heard her and her bf having sex before and it's the same voice And says the same things. 

After almost 7 years and helping him... I supported him in every way- THIS is what I get. I've forgiven him when he did not deserve it. I kept a roof over his head. And I was totally loyal to him in every way. Yet I'm not even worth the truth! 

I haven't figured out what I want to say to him. I think I'll just make him a slideshow of all the screen shots! And then make him leave. I knew I was right!

Two short trips. I met a (insert country 1) woman (7/10) in the dr and a (insert country 2) woman 9/10 in nyc. My latest fling reaches out. My ex, who is my ideal woman aside from the lethal toxicity, starts talking to me again. Theyre all hispanic. Im a white ass justin beiber lookin ass mf but uglier. I never cheated and never will. Im technically single up until this point. Nothing has been made official. However, hispanic women, in my experience, move like the flash. So it took all but 1-2 weeks for a combined total of these incidences to occur and grow to fruition. Now im stuck disingenuously saying “buenas noches amor” to 2 somewhat meaningful flings, 1 toxic 4yr ex that will never work out, and 1 former fling that lost my interest practically since the beginning. 

Former fling is the least of my issues. She can be crossed off the chart immediately. 

The two newest flings are ..or just should be.. flings ..  but i catch feelings way too easily. 

Im a huge pu zzy ass biznatch who would rather hurt himself than hurt someone elses’ feelings for the sake of literally everyone involved. This has been so mentally draining, anxiety inducing, and genuinely uncomfortable, idk what to do other than see a therapist for which I already made an appointment. I think my level of idiocracy.

I literally didnt speak a lick of the language 5 years ago and now thats all i speak. Break it off from the catalyst relationship? No, i guess id rather spare her feelings and learn a new language from scratch while taking care of two children of which arent my own. We separated last year but i still take the kiddos out. We went to a trampoline park this past weekend. 

My lack of a spinal cord has contributed to my own happiness deficiency meanwhile constructing false hopes for everyone else involved. Idk how to stop it, how to fix it, nor how to learn from it and move on",1,0,2025-11-07T07:50:56+00:00,https://reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/1oqofep/i_feel_like_im_being_a_manwhore_and_its_draining/,Negative
reddit,OffMyChest,1oqoexz,Vanesspresso,a20f6e2326964f2e,"I’m glad he’s getting help, but I wish someone had helped me too.","I live in my S.O.’s hometown. I left my family and friends back home. All was pretty well though to be honest. My hometown was a mini roadtrip away. I would make plans ahead of time and call whenever we were available. Meet half way to hang out. No big deal.

It was until I gave birth to my first child. We couldn’t afford the childcare in our area and I only had enough saved for 2 months on rent (for emergencies). We split the bills in half. 
“That’s ok! Family will always be there.”
 It got to a point where I was missing a lot of work because my child wouldn’t eat unless I was there and she was losing a lot of weight. His family also became unreliable. So at my job, I became unreliable. I became a stay at home mom. 

Fortunately, with a single income, we are blessed/spoiled to be able to afford having a roof over our heads and not stressing paycheck to paycheck.

During the 8 months postpartum, I started hating myself, I felt so isolated being at home. I missed work. My child was VERY difficult in terms of sleep and feeding. I was overwhelmed, I felt fat,….I was having a hard time being happy. Nothing I did was right. I asked the women in my life for advice and what I got was:

“just get out of the house. Go to the park.”
“try to view things differently”
“why are you unhappy? You have everything at home.”
“Oh wait until you have more kids”
“There are others who have it way worst”
“At least you’re not a single mom and need a job”

I ended up crying every night and sneaking to the couch to sleep by myself. I was isolating myself further. I also hid it from my partner so I wouldn’t be a burden. I can’t even remember how or what I did to get myself to power through. I fought my inner demons so hard and told myself to be the best I could possibly be. I really should have gotten myself checked or help, but I somehow did it. I forced my way through the thick black fog until it became clear.

Fast forward:
I am currently still a stay at home mom and 3 months postpartum with my second child. It is surprisingly going SO much better than I anticipated. I have been able to manage my time better. I can spend some time enjoying things that I love to do. We still can’t afford the childcare, but we still live comfortably. I hang out and spend some time with friends and family from time to time. It’s going pretty well.

Now, ever since my partner has returned to work from his paternity leave, I have felt his stress radiating off of him. He typically comes home from work and helps with half of the child and cleaning load to give me a little break. He didn't want to admit that work has been hard on him, but I knew and tried getting him to just relax. I was in a good place mentally to be able to handle the babies on my own. I wanted to do what I could to support him. He wouldn't relax. He still helped with chores and the babies.

A few days ago though, he came home and told me that he broke down to his boss. He told him that with all the new changes and policies, he has been struggling to keep up with the demands. Boss supported him and said that he needed to take care of himself. Told him to take a few days off and that when he returns, him and his team will help him catch up. My partner’s family also came by with food as a pick me up. Others offered to take the babies out for a few hours so we can spend some time together.

I am really glad that he is giving himself a break and taking care of himself. It’s also super amazing that his job has allowed him to take time off for his mental well being, but at the same time….WTF! Where was this fucken support when I needed it?!

TL;DR: Had my first child and had to leave my job to be a stay at home mom due to their wellbeing and child care. Became depressed and asked for guidance, but had lack of support and resources. I overcame my inner demons and have been doing much better mentally. Now my partner starts going through some work stress; he gets support from his job, friends and family.",1,0,2025-11-07T07:50:08+00:00,https://reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/1oqoexz/im_glad_hes_getting_help_but_i_wish_someone_had/,Negative
reddit,OffMyChest,1oqo9qv,Mister23-0,e5d861b0ad4c7ccb,I cried after reading about how much ancient Indian science was lost and ignored.,"We were always told that modern science started in the West. But when I started reading old Indian texts out of curiosity, I was stunned. Thousands of years ago, people like Aryabhata and Varāhamihira had already calculated planetary orbits, eclipses, even the distance between the Earth and the Sun with numbers that are surprisingly close to what we know today. The Surya Siddhanta, for example, places the Sun about 15 million yojanas away roughly 125 million miles. That’s not a myth. That’s math and observation.

Then I found out what happened next. Universities like Nalanda and Takshashila were burned. Countless manuscripts were destroyed or stolen. During colonial times, whatever survived was dismissed as “mythology” while Western systems were built using the same mathematical foundations that originally came from India, the concept of zero, the decimal system, trigonometry. All rebranded and exported back to us like it was new.

It honestly broke me. To think that an entire civilization’s scientific heritage was erased, and then the credit went elsewhere.

This isn’t about blame. It’s about acknowledgment. If the world recognized how much knowledge was lost, maybe we could rebuild some of it and give those early thinkers the respect they deserve.

If anyone knows projects or archives that are working to digitize or repatriate old Indian manuscripts, please drop them here.

reddit,OffMyChest,1oq10k7,Lazy-Philosopher-340,dab488a17c4ca18b,Off my chest i am done,"

Here goes my rant — young folks, take this as a fucking cautionary tale.

I’m a 40-year-old man, and I’m done being the “good son.” I grew up lower middle class. My dad did what he could, but because of endless family drama and bad planning, I couldn’t study further. Had to start working early because my dad did zero financial planning. Not entirely his fault, but still — his business crashed, he never upskilled, never thought about the future.

After my 12th exams, I jumped into call centers since I was decent at communication. My dad had a mountain of private debt, and I spent years paying it off. By 2020, I was finally debt-free. You’d think that’d be a proud moment, right? Nope.

I still remember in August 2020, I told my dad I was finally debt-free — and he fucking lost it. He said, “You’ll always be in my debt. Now you need to buy a house.”
That broke me. I didn’t want a damn house. I wanted peace. But no — in Indian families, what relatives say matters more than your sanity. So I caved.

In 2021, I bought a flat I never wanted. Drained 90% of my PF, took a loan for the rest. I was earning fine back then, but my so-called “smart” father doesn’t believe in medical insurance or planning for emergencies. And since then, my mom’s health has gone to shit. She’s been in the hospital for the last 9 days, and every damn month, a huge part of my salary goes into medical bills.

I’m just… done. I’m tired of being responsible for everything and everyone. Tired of being guilt-tripped into choices I never wanted. Tired of living for people who don’t give a shit about my mental health.

To every young person reading this — move out as soon as you can. Don’t let “log kya kahenge” or parental guilt traps ruin your life. Parents aren’t always right, and they’re not always kind. Some of them will drain you dry and call it love.

Every day I wake up wishing I wasn’t here anymore. Sometimes I think it’d be easier if my insurance money could give them the comfortable life they always wanted — in the dream house that already feels like my grave

Everything between us is great — she’s kind, caring, cooks for me, we spend a lot of time together, have good sex, and we’re even planning a trip outside soon. She’s affectionate and says that she’s falling for me.

But there’s one thing I can’t stop thinking about — her past.

I made her tell me about it (basically forced the conversation, which I regret now), and she shared everything honestly. She lost her virginity at 19 to a 28-year-old Kurdish guy she dated for a while, then had a 2-year relationship with a Polish boyfriend. After moving to Warsaw, she dated a Turkish guy for about 1.5 years, and during that “situationship,” she said she made a few mistakes — gave oral sex to another Turkish guy she met through friends, and once to a Peruvian man she met at a bar when she was drunk, she went her home and gave him a BJ. In total, she said she slept with three guys and had those two other encounters.

She didn’t hide anything, didn’t lie, and she seems genuinely different now — more grounded and emotionally mature. But ever since I heard all that, I can’t stop thinking about it. I keep imagining things, even during work. I know it’s her past, and she treats me so well now, but my mind keeps replaying those images and it’s making me anxious and distant.

She hasn’t done anything wrong to me, and I know I shouldn’t judge someone for their past, but I can’t seem to shake this feeling.

I just don’t know what to do. How do I stop obsessing over this? How do I move on from these thoughts and actually enjoy what we have now?

Is it normal to feel this way, or am I just being insecure?

Why do we keep believing potential will eventually turn into effort? Why do we keep nurturing men who can’t even meet us halfway?

It’s heartbreaking to watch women pour every ounce of themselves into someone who won’t even lift a finger to grow. We convince ourselves that love will change him, that maybe if we love harder, he’ll finally see us, appreciate us, match our energy. But love alone doesn’t build a life. It doesn’t pay bills, heal exhaustion, or fill the silence when you realize you’ve been carrying the whole relationship on your back.

I think we stay because we confuse comfort with connection, and we’re scared to admit that love isn’t always enough. But one day, you wake up and realize that being loved by someone lazy feels lonelier than being alone.

I’m proud of keeping them safe and loved, but I’m also exhausted. It’s hard pretending I’m okay when I’m not.

reddit,OffMyChest,1oqnps4,CantAffordTherapy22,4c1aa76446f3d241,Im pretty sure im a pathological liar and its ruining my life,"For context im a 23M and I would consider myself a relatively normal and nice guy. Unlike other people on here talking about their lying, I grew up in a loving environment with a great family and friends. 

I have lied every single day of my life for as long as I can remember- to basically every single person in my life. I rarely ever do it to make myself look cool, in-fact sometimes make up a self deprecating lie to make them more believable. Most of the time I will lie just to fill the empty gaps in conversation or to get onto a subject i where i already know what im gonna say. For example, if someone asks me how my day went, I might start saying that I went to uni and the lecturer called me out for being late. I might say how it scares people who are running late from turning up at all and we’ll pivot into a 20min conversation about attendance… but i didnt go to uni that day. I didnt have any lectures. 

That might not seem bad (or maybe it does ive lost all reference for how much people normally fib), but the sheer volume of lies i tell is frankly unbelievable as I do this pretty much everytime i have a conversation where a person asks me about myself. Its become such a habit for me that i dont feel any physical difference when lying compared to actually telling the truth. Its honestly weird for me when i see people stressing about keeping a secret or debating whether to tell a white lie to not hurt someones feeling, because i know i wouldnt even have to think about it.

Im incredibly good at it now so my friends never call me out which I think ive always subconsciously wanted so id be forced to stop. I would like to just come clean but i kinda think its engrained into human nature to hate liars and I know people would lose trust in me forever. I honestly think my friends/family would care less about me committing a violent crime than finding out im a pathological liar. Id like to seek professional help but i don’t have the money to and id probably just lie to the doctor anyway.

It makes me pretty good at amongus tho.

reddit,OffMyChest,1oqnol4,Purple_Inevitable_74,2875c415dbad4020,I fell for a girl I cannot be with,"I(26M) moved to a new town earlier this year and within a couple of months, I met someone(24F). From the beginning, she was honest about how she’d be moving at the end of the year to a state that’s at least 500 miles away. She’ll be moving to pursue a career that she’s always dreamt of having. She feels that this move will teach her how to be independent as she has always had the support of her amazing family. She set clear boundaries and said the move is a must and she has to do it by herself. We both knew it would be temporary. She made it clear from the get go how important these goals are to her.

So at first, we would spend time casually. It was nothing too serious because we knew it was short term, but we really hit it off. We ended up falling for each other. It all happened so quickly. I don’t know if we took it too far, knowing that there was an expiration date, or if it was inevitable that we grew so close. I needed some space to think things through, knowing that she’s made plans to move independently before we’d even met.

After several hard conversations, we agreed that continuing our relationship is irresponsible and we would only end up hurting each other more. I really fucking want to be with her, even long distance, but I think she was on the verge of sacrificing her goals so we could be together. I was terrified that one day, she might resent me for being the reason she never accomplished those goals. Idk, I want her in my life but I’m afraid that there’s no healthy way to do that. I feel happy and lucky to have met her. She told me she feels the same. But I feel guilty for causing her pain at the same time. 

TLDR: dated irresponsibly, broke up with GF for logistical/emotional timing issues, feel guilty for making her sad. Am sad lol.

reddit,OffMyChest,1oqnllf,Direct_Sundae9139,5ce4e451da62a7b7,Can't get over my friend,"I'll try to keep this as brief as possible.Basically, I have a friend with whom I've hooked up with a few times. The first time was early this year during a house party and it was insane. She started it and we almost went *ALL* the way, but we didn't. During this encounter, she scrambled my brain and confused tf outta me: said I was hers and she was mine, that no matter how many other girls I had been with, she would always be the ""one"" (not like the one for me, but like... the ONE yk? At least that's what I understood), her dirty talk was outta this world and I may or may not have said ""I love you"" a lot. We sobered up the next day and tried to pretend like nothing had happened. I was unable to do so, as I felt like I was going to blow up if I didn't tell anybody and tried to straighten things out with her, so I did. We texted and basically agreed on ""we did it to strengthen our friendship, no biggie. Nothing happened"" and life went on. Then a few months later. While we (the whole friend group) were at the club, she suddenly became VERY friendly towards me; sharing her cig and drink and dancing/singing with me. Now... I'm not stupid (though this story may lead you to believe so) and I knew what was coming next. She asked me to walk her to the bathroom and as soon as we got there... bam. Making out, groping, teasing... the whole 9. It got intense FAST and I was honestly thrilled. The rest of the night was an elaborate scheme to finish what we had started, but since we were staying at my best friends place it was kinda difficult (and felt wrong). Next morning though, she moved from the couch she was on to the bed I was on and... you guessed it, round 3. This time it was as close as we had ever gotten, but she ended up getting cold feet.

Why you may ask? Well... she has a ***BOYFRIEND.*** They were just seeing each other during Hookup 1 but they were already formally officially together during Hookup 2. I was well aware, of course, and I do feel bad. And before we go any further, I have a ***GIRLFRIEND,*** but we got together after everything happened (were just talking during Hookup 2). But this leads me to the actual thing I need to get off my chest: *what the fuck is going through our heads?*  
Now let me actually tell you about this girl; the most stunning curly, jet black hair, DIVINE face and body, amazing personality, nice, funny, caring and just beautiful all around. However! I don't like *like* her, yk? It's not like I want to go out with her and be her boyfriend or anything like that, but it's not like I just lust after her and want her just for her body (reminder that she started 2/3 encounters). I don't feel what I feel for my gf but I don't feel just friendship towards her. And as for what she feels towards me.. I don't even think God knows. She obviously likes to have me under her spell and likes to have control/ownership over me (the whole ""you're mine"" thing, which she said UNPROVOKED a lotta times), and she has expressed a general dislike towards my gf (without even knowing her, smh). But I just don't know how to feel or what to do, and every time we go out together (with the rest of our friends) my heart starts racing bc I think it could happen again, though now that I'm taken it most likely very probably won't.  
This is the most confusing relationship/bond I've ever experienced, help?

TL;DR: Hooked up with a friend 3 times, we're both taken now and I'm scared/excited it could happen again. I don't know how to go about things.",1,0,2025-11-07T06:57:54+00:00,https://reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/1oqnllf/cant_get_over_my_friend/,Positive
reddit,OffMyChest,1oqnijm,nokomitsu,e5820d703d2b6226,My inability to control my thoughts and emotions makes me feel as if I'm a pervert (21f),"I don't know how to begin to put any of what I'm feeling into words. I feel overwhelmed by every negative emotion I have and I think it's starting to, or at some point will, affect my relationships. When I feel happy, which is becoming a rare occurrence as of lately, I feel as if I'll never come down from it, I can do anything, but it doesn't last long, at least not genuinely, and I feel as if everyone can tell when I'm forcing it after the genuine happiness runs out. I smile too much, act too friendly just because I know I should and don't want to disappoint by reverting back into my bad attitudes. When I feel negative emotions, like anger, stress, sadness or frustration, I often times imagine myself in scenarios that I know I shouldn't to justify feeling that way. The scenarios in my head are often violent and sexual or emotionally painful, I worry that these thoughts may be my true nature and maybe I'm destined to succumb to them in the future. I've felt this way for a long time, since I was a teen, and I have met a few other women my age who have had similar thoughts, but they really are few and far between and I've only encountered them because of my weird online presence which makes me think maybe ""normal"" functioning adult women don't think like this.
A lot of my thoughts spiral into sexual depravity, I don't know why or how I could've developed this tendency, but I have entire notebooks full of these scenarios because maybe I'm not as ashamed of them as I should be. I don't know if that's why, but I can't think of any other reason that I keep these thoughts documented. I've tried many times to stop the thoughts, but as I said, I just can't stop them from coming, and I cannot regulate my emotions that well.
Sorry, I know it's all over the place, but it's late and I just needed to express it so I could hopefully go to bed feeling a bit lighter seeing as though diary entries are no longer helping relieve this stress... if anyone relates or has any advice as to how to help the spiraling, I'd really appreciate a conversation",1,7,2025-11-07T06:52:31+00:00,https://reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/1oqnijm/my_inability_to_control_my_thoughts_and_emotions/,Negative
reddit,OffMyChest,1oqjcqh,ThrowRAChael,43b3a87329e77bcb,she’s ruined me mentally.,"I relapsed.

Recently, my ex and I broke up, and ever since it happened, I’ve felt so ugly. The strange thing is, this is the best I’ve ever looked. I’ve got shredded, lost face fat, started eating clean, been going to the gym regularly, and developed a proper skin and hair care routine. To be clear, I was never heavy, but I just wanted to slim down more and get a leaner face.

Despite all this, I still feel so ugly, even though only last month she used to tell me how good-looking I was. I honestly thought she was the prettiest girl ever. For context, she cheated on me before we broke up and started talking to someone else — an older guy who’s around twenty-four, while I’m twenty-one. I sit here comparing myself to someone older, yet I know that by his age I’ll have put the work in and become even better. He’s not even remotely handsome, but I keep beating myself up over it.

The last time I spoke to her was a week ago, when I asked if she was happy, and she refused to answer. She and this guy aren’t even dating, and to be honest, I don’t know if they’re still talking. This morning I got a call from a no caller ID number at 7:40 a.m., and I know it was her — she waited for me to say hello and then ended the call. It really messed with my head because I’d been doing well for a week. I’d made a list, told myself I wouldn’t look at old pictures or her accounts, and I’d actually stuck to it.

Today, after that call, I relapsed so badly. I literally sat staring at her face for five minutes straight, just hating myself, even though she’s the one who did me wrong. I just wish I felt whole. I’m on the best path I’ve ever been on in my life — in terms of self-care, academics, friends, and career goals — yet despite all that, I still feel like an absolute loser.

When we broke up, the first thing she did was change her profile pictures to more attractive and revealing ones, and even changed her bio to “Tall, dark and handsome.” Why am I beating myself up over a woman like that, let alone going on an entire journey of self-loathing because of her? I feel awful for relapsing, especially when I’d been feeling so good.

How do I feel better? And am I valid for seeing the way she’s treated me as wrong?",2,2,2025-11-07T03:06:43+00:00,https://reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/1oqjcqh/shes_ruined_me_mentally/,Negative

We have a deep friendship as well as an intimate and sexual connection, though we’re not officially together. We talk every day and have always felt emotionally aligned - until last week.

We’re ethically polyamorous, so I don’t mind them sleeping with other people. But they recently told me about a hookup with someone who was already in a relationship. That person came on to them saying their partner couldn’t please them sexually, and they went through with it. They described it like it was just a hot, fleeting thing.

Even though I can understand the surface-level thrill, I find it deeply unethical to knowingly engage with someone who’s cheating. When I explained my feelings, they actually listened and said they could see my point - but also mocked me playfully for taking it so seriously.

Since then, I can’t shake this sense of disconnection. It’s made me question whether our values are too different for me to feel close to them in the same way.

Back story:

Since December of last year, my wife and I have been involved in the IVF process. Tens of thousands of dollars, hundreds of injections, and dozens of doctor appointments. Two weeks back, the embryo was transferred.

My wife has an oddly specific job. My child and I are deeply intwined in it, as it is a community-based career. Six weeks ago, HR said they had concerns about her performance and immediately put her on an improvement plan.

So last weekend:

Friday - My wife gets scammed by someone claiming there’s a warrant for her arrest. Made it all very believable with documentation. We lost $3k.

Saturday - Pregnancy test at home. Positive.

Sunday - HR says she did everything on the improvement plan but they’re still going to terminate her. 50% of our income. Because it is oddly specific, we will likely have to relocate to find her another job. Also, without revealing too much, my life and my daughter’s life are deeply intwined with her career. We have essentially been exiled from a community.

Monday - blood test confirms she’s pregnant.

Always been into girls (have dated guys in the past, and while I do think a part of me is genuinely bisexual, I can’t see myself in a relationship with one because I’ll be treated as “the girl”), had some masculine interests (martial arts, metal, gaming, medieval history)… but I’ve been told I’m really feminine. I’ve had to dress femme because of my family, and since moving out at 18, I never felt free enough to stop the habit. I’ve done minor things - I used to bind before getting into a relationship (more on that later), I even changed my name to something androgynous, I started eating differently to gain muscle - but I still hate how I look. I’m conventionally attractive for a woman, and I do tend to have a lot of power because of my appearance (which has probably contributed to me still dressing femme, even if I’m no longer directly under my parents’ roof), but it’s slowly killing me. 

Everyone’s expectations of me are eating me alive. I have a girlfriend who I love very much, but she’s said she’s a lesbian and that she wouldn’t be able to be with a trans guy even if they got together before he came out. She’s the only person capable of loving me, I think, and I’d be lying if I said she wasn’t one of the main reasons I still look femme. I can’t bear to lose the only person who’s ever understood me, who shares the same interests as me. 

My family thinks I’m too mentally ill or too feminine to be a guy. My dad figured it out, and he’s probably the only one who would accept me if I did come out, but he and I aren’t close for other reasons. I know I would actually spiral into addiction and depression if I lost my girlfriend or the little security I have right now. I’m in therapy, but I can’t even say anything to my therapist because he’s outright told me he thinks I’m feminine before. I know I’ll lose all social power if I transition, and my only hope is to try and repress until I’m no longer seen as attractive, that way I reap the benefits while I still can. I know I won’t pass - I’m too short, too curvy, too round-faced. But being seen as a woman is slowly killing me. I’ve been on and off suicidal for years. I’ve used guys I don’t even like and done drugs just to feel something again. 

The only thing that’s keeping me sane is an online persona where I do exist as a guy and people without fail treat me as one because of my interests and my pfp. Even this, though, I live in constant fear of my girlfriend finding. If she did, I know she’d break up with me - not out of anger, but because she’d think her being a lesbian is holding me back, and she’d want to take herself out of the equation. Without her, I’d probably just end up back with my parents, and then I’d actually have no autonomy anymore. The only thing I can hope for at this point is that some day someone will clock me as closeted and force me to confess, that someday I’ll no longer be attractive and won’t have anything else to lose, that the reason I’m not close with my dad will take itself out and maybe I’ll be able to tell him properly, or that eventually I’ll just grow too sick of this and end it.",2,0,2025-11-07T02:12:54+00:00,https://reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/1oqi818/im_trans_and_i_cant_tell_anyone/,Negative
reddit,OffMyChest,1oqmlf5,limit_209,4215084c89834880,Dream of having sex with my friend,"Hey Reddit, this is an alternate account that I created just because of this.


So I (M) have a friend (F) that we’ve known each other for roughly 8 years. Went to school and even worked our first jobs together. I’ve never had any sexual or physical attraction towards her. She’s a decent, pretty woman. We are both married.


Now, yesterday I had a very vivid dream about her. It was so real, I remember everything, except the sex part. Basically the dream went like this, we were working and there was this ally way where I ended up falling asleep. But in the dream I was only half asleep, then I heard her coming by and giving me friendly kisses on my cheek. I decided to kiss her forreals which surprised her because she pulled back and said something along the lines of “omg why did he kiss me like that?” Then she walked away, mind you I was still half asleep.


After a while, I got up and went to sleep on a couch with a blanket. Then she came by, took my blanket and slept on the ground next to me. For some reason, i felt that she intentionally wanted me to go down and sleep with her, so my half asleep ass went down and slept with her.


Again, I didn’t remember but about the actual deed, but it sorta cut in and out. But eventually the morning came and I was laying next to her thinking to myself how hot that was.


I woke up right after that with a hard erection. Gosh I was so turned on that I felt so guilty because my wife was sleeping next to me while I’m getting one of the hardest erections ever.


I ended up going to the restroom at 3am and rub one out. Since then, I can’t stop thinking about out it. Not that I want to have sex with her in real life, but just the rush and feeling that I felt in my dream. I want to feel that again, especially since I didn’t really remember the actual deed.

TLDR: Had a dream having sex with friend. Can’t stop thinking about it.",1,0,2025-11-07T05:58:05+00:00,https://reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/1oqmlf5/dream_of_having_sex_with_my_friend/,Negative

On another note, do you guys know that feeling of needing to shit all day and after you finally do you feel a sense of harmony throughout yourself? I felt that same feeling after the pressure was relieved (no porn involved). I feel like I felt true internal harmony. I felt the need to share this but didn't have anyone to say it to so I posted here, hope you guys get a kick out of it.

My grandmother passed away recently. She was literally the only real family I had. The only person who ever made me feel safe or loved. Losing her feels like someone ripped the floor out from under me. I haven’t even been able to process it or grieve properly because life just refuses to give me a second to breathe.

I had just started a new job with TSA. I really thought it was my chance to finally get some stability and start moving forward. Then the government shutdown happened right after I started and I haven’t even gotten my first paycheck. I’m trying to secure a small apartment and now I don’t even know how I’m supposed to keep a roof over my head or keep myself together.

And this shutdown just pushed me even closer to the edge. It feels like the people in charge don’t understand how many real people are hurting because of this. I’m already broken from losing my grandmother and now I’m worried about where I’m even going to live. It’s too much for one person.

I feel so overwhelmed. I feel alone. I feel like everything is piling on top of me and I don’t have anyone to lean on. I’m trying to stay strong but honestly… I’m exhausted.

I was born into an abusive household, my parents were anti establishment nutcases and decided to homeschool us despite not having the necessary training or dedication to do it without fucking the rest of our lives.
They didn't even send us to the doctor or dentist because of fear.
I was expected to learn on my own with little help at all and no mental health support for my OCD so naturally I cheated on the harder subjects past arithmetic and business math.
As a result, I'm a ""high school graduate"" who can't even do basic algebra and only arithmetic and business math.
I don't even have a basic understanding of modern science.
I'm illiterate and can't analyze books for shit even if I can read, can't write a fucking essay.
I'm so behind my peers on everything relevant to a good education, it makes me so fucking angry at my parents.
This is especially depressing because my dream is to attend a decent state college, but I feel too stupid to even set foot in such a place.
I get paid 20 dollars an hour doing repetitive, manual labor that drains the life out of me, I'm thankful for the job but it also depresses me.
My parents aren't that way anymore, they're somewhat normal with a touch of crazy, but the damage is already done.
I'm forced to live with them currently due to finances and I barely tolerate it due to the money I save but I feel stuck.
I just feel so robbed of a basic foundation to standard education that so many people take for granted and it's killing me inside.
Hopefully there is some light at the end of this depressingly dark tunnel because I am totally lost.
End of rant, thanks for listening sigh....

reddit,OffMyChest,1oqemfz,throwusallaway45,f4bc866e00c8638d,I’m being transferred to another department at work. I’ve been crying almost all day.,"I (29F) want to preface by saying that I’m thankful to have a job, especially given the misfortune that other people are facing in this current climate.

But I was told this morning that I am being transferred to another department at work, and I will have a completely different manager, team, job title, and responsibilities. The reason they gave is that it had nothing to do with my performance but they “thought I was ready for a new challenge.”

My pay will stay the same, but I get the impression that the new position is not only more stressful, but I’ve heard that the new department has a lot of drama. (In my current team, people get along pretty well and/or keep to themselves.)

I like my current manager. I like my team. I like the other people in the department. I like my job and I feel like I do well at it. I feel fulfilled at the end of the day, as well as appreciated. And I genuinely appreciated those things.

I don’t know if it’s the initial shock but I cried for 3.5 hours at my desk (if anyone noticed, they didn’t say anything, which I appreciate) before I finally got the OK from my current manager to go home early. I calmed down for a bit once I got home, but if I think about it for too long, I cry again.

Even though HR and my current manager said this didn’t have anything to do with my performance and that they think I’m a good worker, it feels… punitive? 

I’m sure I’m overreacting, but I’ve been steady with my meds, I’ve talked to loved ones about it, and I’ve tried to do productive or fun things with the time off, but I just cannot seem to get a grip.

I've been active with both of my kids and my wife - I help with the day to day activities the best I can after working and try to play some games or  watch some shows with my 7 year old when he's done with school. More and more though lately when I'm left alone and not doing anything I just.. exist I guess. Videogames aren't really that fun anymore, books either and if you combine this year with all the shit from last year then it just hits me how numb I'm feeling.

He was at the bar for 2 hours, he stopped with some buddies after work. He drove 20+ minutes home. He could hardly walk straight. He came in, gave me a single kiss on the forehead, took a shower and went straight to bed without saying a word to me. All before 6pm yesterday. I’d had just gotten off work, picked up my kid, and was making dinner. He’s been drinking nonstop for months. I keep making excuses, but for some reason, today feels different. He chose alcohol. He took all the risks of driving home. It all feels so….selfish. I just want to cry. I want to scream because it’s not fair, everything was so great for the first couple of years but now everything is…sad. I love him. I hate when he drinks. I can’t force him to stop, he won’t go to therapy, and he gets offended when I bring up going to the doctor. He’s on medication that you’re not supposed to mix with alcohol. Hes not healthy-I’m scared, and frustrated, and heartbroken. But, more important than anything else, I have to keep my child safe and healthy, and shielded from the habits of an alcoholic.

TLDR: my bf came home drunk at 6 pm, and I’m worried for his health, and frustrated with how his drinking is impacting our relationship.

Update: I originally posted this elsewhere before it got removed from that subreddit, since I wasn’t really asking for advice at first. However, he texted me this morning to say I’m sorry, and I don’t know how to respond. Here’s what his text said: “I’m sorry about yesterday babe I really am I feel like shit about the whole thing and it will never happen again I love you and I super duper sorry” 

I know I can’t move on from this, but I need to words of encouragement. Leaving him will not be easy for me or my kid. I’ve learned a lot from this experience, and know in my heart of hearts I will never bring my kid into another situation like this. Grateful kiddo never saw the worst, and we’re getting out before kiddo even knows what’s going on. 

Update #2: he left work early today, brought me flowers and food, and apologized in length. He says he’s going to stop drinking, and he realizes it’s gotten out of control. He says he feels awful about putting me in that situation. He swears it will never happen again. It seems genuine; he never gets me flowers, and isn’t the type to apologize easily. I trust him, but I don’t trust an alcoholic, so I guess idk. But I can’t stop thinking of how I felt last night, looking at him laying in bed, trashed. The best I can describe it is, the ick. Idk.

Basically... Liam (16) is my cousin, not by blood but I still think he is morally frowned upon.

I met him when we were children, 7 or 8 years old I think. He was always that quiet boy who followed me everywhere and did everything I said. At that time it seemed cute to me but not so much to adults.

His mother is my father's half-sister, and she left him at my house because she didn't want to support him, they had gone through some relationship problem I think. And since my parents didn't want to take care of it either, the cleaning lady was the one who literally adopted him and after 3 years she took him to another city.

Now that my parents want to make the transition for some reason, they brought him back home, politically he would no longer be my cousin when he was adopted by a third person)?

Things happened and my boyfriend noticed something else, my friends also started to walk away. I used to treat Liam badly because I didn't like remembering that we were family, I was embarrassed and I didn't like to admit it either.
The only one who stayed was Liam, unconditionally and despite the fact that I misbehaved with him.

Sometimes I think I'm using it or I just like how it makes me feel. But he's the only one who really understands me and knows why I do what I do. He always tells me what I want to hear and knows me so well. 

I don't know if I love it or if I hate it. But every time I try to push him away, he ends up looking for me like a little dog.

Maybe my boyfriend was right to leave and I pushed him to do so.

So almost two years ago I was going to college. My math teacher was a total spazz and we ran out of time for presentations, so she told me and my partner to go to her office hours the next day, Wednesday.

I went to school early this day so I could find out where her office was and practice our presentation. I had never been to this building before, so my friend and I agreed to meet there 15 minutes early to practice one more time. The building was super cool, with like an indoor courtyard and that’s where we were sitting. There was another guy and another girl sitting around as well.

We heard three loud bangs, the other girl took off but we sat there confused. I thought someone had dropped books off the balcony or something. Next I heard a loud woman’s scream followed by more bangs and no more screaming. At this point the rest of us took off. Shots were being fired as we left the building. My friend stopped into another classroom on the way out and asked if they heard the shots. They didn’t.

We keep running, screaming at people that there was a shooter. They looked at us weird and kept walking towards the building. Running for your life while people look at you like youre crazy was something that will stick with me forever. Once we got to my friends car, that’s when we started hearing sirens. The other guy that was there had called 911 while we were running.

My friend dropped me off at home, which was close to the college. For the next hour I heard a loud sirens nonstop.


And that’s it. People asked me about it a bit the month after, but never since. I feel like my trauma isn’t as bad as others, since I never really saw anything and was able to get away. It’s just crazy that I likely saw the shooter walk past me to get up the stairs. My friend was only for that class, so we’ve never really talked since either. 

Anyways, I finally feel ready to seek therapy and I am proud of myself. I compartmentalized it for so long, I feel like I needed to get it off my chest. Thanks for reading.

Why did I get it unconventional.,"I’m 28M and I’m still emotionally at times thinking about problems that happend in my childhood. When I was younger I had a learning disability and I struggled with math. Like it was the hardest thing like my math skills are not like shitty. They were off the charts bad. I barely even got the most basic understanding all the way into high school and I still struggle with it today. I’m also on the autism spectrum and when I was in elementary school I struggled, but it didn’t. I didn’t notice it as bad until I got into middle school. During my early childhood. I was much more confident. I had good friends I took normal mainstream classes. My teachers were always very supportive of me. They treated me like I mattered and that I was important. They always said if you love what you do follow it don’t give up on your dreams like a teacher should. But once I got in the middle school, they started noticing how bad I wasn’t math and then they started telling me what my limitations were. Same with my parents my parents were never optimist. They were never overly optimistic. I mean this is what I noticed when I was in when I started high school. They would always talk about how hard life is and sometimes life just doesn’t turn out the way you want that’s why you gotta just accept that. There are some hard truths to life. Honestly, I wish my parents just never said a word just never said anything and I wish that the entire structure society. Just treated me the same way and didn’t look at me as someone who had a disability or somebody who is socially awkward. They just looked at me like everybody else. And treated me like I was equally capable of achieving the same things whether it was in relationships, status 
,money. Getting the career I wanted like if I just had a hands off approach if people just weren’t telling me you gotta be realistic you gotta reconsider things.

But I keep wondering: when does it ever feel done?

You reach a goal, feel good for a bit, and then immediately create a harder one.  
The finish line just moves further away.  
And even though I know growth is good, it sometimes feels like I’m just endlessly chasing something.

Before I started caring about self-improvement, I was less “optimized,” but maybe more content I was just seeing where life was taking me and happy with that.  
Now I’m more capable and productive, yet that deep satisfaction feels harder to reach.

So I’m curious, when do people actually feel like they’ve “completed” life, or at least reached a point of real happiness?  
Is there such a thing as genuine completion, or do we just learn to be at peace while still moving forward?",19,16,2025-11-05T19:38:01+00:00,https://reddit.com/r/happiness/comments/1opctvf/if_theres_always_a_next_goal_when_do_you_actually/,Positive

Disliking reality is unhappiness. We all move toward outcomes that seem beneficial, but everything happens according to cause and effect, not our wishes. We experience some level of unhappiness when we dislike how things turned out, and wanting reality to turn out in specific ways is the cause of that dislike. Our mind makes better decisions when it isn’t clouded by upset, which allows us to approach situations objectively: here's the world; what makes sense to do next?

reddit,happiness,1nmhne1,Affectionate_Look235,bbcaa49fe3009f85,Happiness and fulfilment,"The history of humanity is speculated to date back 2 million years, with a written record that goes back from 3200 bc to 3000 bc. Till now, we have progressed massively. Changes occurred not just in our civilization overall, since the first human breathed on earth's surface; when we take a glance everywhere outside, changes are still continuous and rapid. 

But there is a subtle observation which is unexpectedly not surprising that humans' persuasion of eternal happiness or fulfilment hasn't changed even in the earliest recorded history. Still, internally our primary desire is the same, like still figuring out which contradicts how much progress we have made for the civilization.

""happiness"", if you inquire anyone randomly from any region in the world. One line or desire you will find common in every individual: ""I want to be happy"". From the perspective of a third species or entity, this will be shocking. Asking "" how could every individual on the planet with a population exceeding 8 billion have one core desire. Not just today, take any point of human history from the Stone Age to the 21st century, even considering every stage of human life from toddler to man in his deathbed.

Another word, ""fulfilment"", which is widely associated with long-term happiness or a state of pleasant satisfaction, perhaps another word which is most desired by young adults, whether in their job, marriage, relationship or general work. From my experience, fulfilment is a state of satisfaction, and you start to enjoy little moments without any care. It happens with me when i successfully do everything I decided or planned, and my overall day was productive or didn't get wasted entirely on consumption. Doesn't mean you will experience it too, just by being productive. i consider my most productive time. When I am reading, writing or just doing something that i wanna do not just that even completing other tasks or chores adds up to this. As a result, I feel a sense of satisfaction in the end of the day, which actually feels great. I won't say someone can experience it exactly after completing their work. 

it's my speculation that this state of mind ""fulfilment"" is depended on your belief towards what you like to do or what you consider good productivity. but, I strongly believe the core concept is ""doing"" you did something, why i mentioned ""believe"" because there have been people who did nothing ""productive"" in this term. Still, most fulfilled people, even like noble example, are Lao Tzu, Gautam Buddha, Rama Krishan Prem Hans and so many yogic or spiritual teachers. 

So, magic lies in action? That's what I experience and believe, maybe i am wrong, but it seems least likely to me. Action, no matter the scale, small or big, impacts the external world for eternity. Take the butterfly effect, for instance. ",3,2,2025-09-21T03:33:54+00:00,https://reddit.com/r/happiness/comments/1nmhne1/happiness_and_fulfilment/,Positive

I recently found the Reiss Motivational Profile. The Reiss Motivational Profile is a scientific assessment of an individual’s intrinsic motives that was created for the purpose of advancing knowledge about human behavior by a famous researcher who has developed other scientific tests. It has helped me understand what motivates me and then adjust my life to achieve value based happiness. 

Since this Reddit forum has a scientific tilt, below is some info I got when I took the Reiss Motivational Profile website about the science behind the test.

 The Reiss Motivational Profile assesses universal goals that motivate everyone.  It was developed using an empirical approach.  It used a preliminary questionnaire with 328 items that covered every conceivable goal that might motivate someone and then used a statistical methodology called factor analysis to interpret the results.  Four separate studies, each with a different sample of subjects, revealed that there are 16 intrinsic motives, or basic desires, that drive human behavior. There is a lot of info on the website that provides more details about the science of the test.

**What if the way we live with time could be different?**

*Less efficient, more human. More careful. More connected. More meaningful.*

As part of my postgraduate research at Leeds Trinity University, I have developed a scientific questionnaire called the Slow Living Scale to explore how people live, or long to live, at a different pace and rhythm. It has been created in collaboration with Slow Living experts and I am excited to share it with you today. This study is an attempt to understand what our relationship with time really looks like in practice. How people make time for what matters, how they choose meaning, care, connection, and depth, and what this might mean for wellbeing.

You are warmly invited to take part. The scales take about 10-15 minutes. They include questions about how you live, what you choose and what you prioritise. It is open to all adults (18+). You do not need to identify as someone who lives “slowly” to take part. The aim of this study is to examine a range of ways of living with time, to better understand people's day to day experiences. Your time, attention, and honest reflections are deeply appreciated. In a culture that celebrates speed, productivity, and distraction your decision to pause and engage in this research is a powerful act. Thankyou.

**Take the scale here:**

**Your voice matters!**

With great gratitude,

reddit,happiness,1mg0cy3,Effective-Pipe2017,06009e20d02e6759,How come everyone’s ditching me?,"I’m 28M and going back to 2021 I feel that I have seen a decline in my friend groups. And it has been a real big problem. For example back in 2018 and 2019 I had lots of freinds many of them I knew from high school. Some from college and some from work. And we would do things like go to bars have parties at each others houses, have house parties go out to clubs. I live in San Diego ca. and we would get in big groups go to the beach, all that cool stuff. But then in 2020 when Covid 19 happened I was 23M that year. And it was a hard time. I was taking classes at Mira costa college. Trying to get my AA. And once everything shut down it all went on line. I dropped out because I didn’t have much I could do. I could take the whole online Zoom stuff. The whole world changed in just one month in March 2020. However during that time. Many of my friends we would still get together and hangout. And we would go to bars hangout at each others homes and have a good time. Even though the pandemic was raging out-of-control, I feel like still had a strong group of friends. And the support group felt strong as well.

But then in the summer of 2021, so around June 2021. That’s when I now started noticing the cracks in the cracks became gaping holes. Like immediately it wasn’t just like one or two friends stopped contacting me, or wouldn’t respond when I would call or text them. One friend went into two friends, and it became four and then six. All in one month July I’d say in the August 2021. In the effort, I try to make new friends. I would get the same reaction. Have you told oh man sorry I got work. I’m going to see my girlfriend. I got a family thing I’m gonna be out of town. Like every single person. Why did it become so hard for anyone to agree to anything? They would say things like oh I got work or I don’t know I have to check my schedule. Let me give you a little tips up OK here’s how you check your schedule you look at your calendar and then the day that’s blank. Yeah, you schedule that day to hang out. That’s why I do it but no they weren’t or how about when you get out of work when you’re off work focus on then I don’t leave it up in the air. And be like I’ll just see how I feel. I went from like in 2020 like having to hang out so weak till like only having five hangouts a month. One of my best friends that I knew since I was in first grade that we were still close with even during the pandemic. Around that time, in September 2020 yeah that’s when he cut off all contact with me. And then, a month later in October one of my best friends moved to Vermont.

But things didn’t become shaky until 2021 one of my good friends. That I knew ever since we were in second grade. We didn’t go to the same elementary school we did go to the same high school together. We were on the wrestling team. But we knew each other in second grade because we were in the Indian guides. And we would do camping trips together when we were little. The last time I saw him in person was in April of 2021. And we hung out and hung out at this bar in Oceanside. I was working a construction job. He was working in tech sales at the time. He was living up in San Jose. Pretty close to San Francisco around the Silicon Valley area. And that was the last time we saw each other, and he came out to San Diego, so many times. And every time I would try to make an attempt to contact him or ask him to do something it would just come up blank. For no reason, but I would see on social media feeds like in stories. He was still meeting up with the guys that we all knew together that we grew up with, but he wouldn’t even tell me that he was in town. And then he moved to Colorado a year later. And he still did the same thing when he would come out here like for business or for just to see his family he would never respond when I found out he was out here. In the way, of course I found out he was out. Here was because of his postings on social media. What he would still meet up with all the old friends they would do things we used to do together like go to Padres games or go surfing. Or go golfing I don’t golf myself though, but big point is they would do stuff together. And then my other friend who has still stayed closer with them him he was working on getting his teaching credentials, and he started teaching in 2023. We were a lot more close we had closer contact although R around the summer of 2021. That’s when we started not being as close as we were. And he started dating this girl in the winter of 2022 and they dated until the spring of 2023 so they met in. I believe February 2022, and then they broke up in like March 2023. I met her twice. She was nice she didn’t cause any problems for me. But either way when they started dating yes I was already losing contact with him and wasn’t as close, but when they started dating, I started seeing him like hardly at all. And please please don’t give me the argument. Well, that’s kind of a normal thing when people go into relationship, bullshit. Because back before 2021 I had friends that had girlfriends and we would still get together and do stuff when I was in my early 20s so now this doesn’t hold up. And I know this for a fact, because I would see them with each other’s girlfriends together on social media they go on outings, and they were still hanging out with all the old guys that we used to know. And they still had a big friend group, despite being in a serious relationship.

Bottom line is this my life was literally hell for two years. From 2020 to 2022. My life just felt like a hollowed out shell. In 2022 I quit my job I thought no sense of purpose. I was drinking every day just to mend the pain. In the thing I don’t understand and I still grapple with this today is how come in 2020 when the pandemic was still raging out of control I would’ve been a time when everyone would’ve been locked in their house is not going anywhere. But the opposite happened in 2020 we were still hanging out and still having a good time. But then, in 2021 when Covid started becoming less of a threat people became less worried about the threat, posed to their lives because we had a vaccine. Businesses were opening up. Life was returning to normal. That would’ve been a time you think in an ideal world that people would be getting together and celebrating but now the opposite happened everyone just started ditching me. I just called him text him get no response and if I did get a response, it was always a no. Not just one or two people but like everybody, I tried to reach out to. In 2021 to 2022 in 2022 when I was 25 I felt like I was 75. Everything just went away because people just couldn’t freaking agree to hang out. I went from having like 20 close friends to only having five close friends. That’s not normal. Usually it would be gradually progressive, not like instantaneously like the house just collapses over you.

So while several years have now passed things have improved. I did get my AA now I’m planning to go back to get my Bachelors. And around 2023 and 2024 I did start making new friends. But things have never been the same. I haven’t had a chance to get a big group of friends together to travel to other countries. Or get invited to people’s Weddings. I don’t wanna exit my 20s and look back at it as a time of regret. I wanna travel the world with my friends. I wanna be there when they get married, I wanna be in there live when they have there first child. And get to congratulate them on having a child of their own.

I’m still asking the question why, why was I cheated and looked out of something I valued.",5,4,2025-08-02T20:25:40+00:00,https://reddit.com/r/happiness/comments/1mg0cy3/how_come_everyones_ditching_me/,Positive

reddit,happiness,1mdixji,documentally,6fb84902bf77a042,The secret of happiness?,"Years ago, while swinging in a hammock in Thailand, I scribbled this in my travel journal:

“The secret of happiness lies not in the acquisition of more, but in developing the capacity to enjoy what is.”

I still believe there’s truth in that. It echoes Stoicism, Buddhism, even modern psychology. The idea that real happiness often comes not from appreciation, presence, and contentment.

But I’ve come to realise that this kind of happiness isn’t equally accessible to everyone. It’s much easier to embrace contentment when your basic needs are met When you're not dealing with illness, pain, financial insecurity or constant stress.

So maybe the principle holds but the privilege to live it doesn't.

Curious to hear others thoughts as to whether contentment is truly within reach for everyone, or is it a luxury we like to pretend is universal?",19,13,2025-07-30T21:23:05+00:00,https://reddit.com/r/happiness/comments/1mdixji/the_secret_of_happiness/,Negative

one evening i walked in my apartment and just didn't sit down. sounds stupid but i put my bag down and immediately changed into gym clothes before my brain could fight back. felt weird as hell. finished a 20 minute workout and honestly it wasn't even good but i felt like i'd won something.

did that for 3 days straight. then a week. now it's been like 8 months and i barely use my couch on weekdays anymore.

i'm not gonna lie and say i'm some super productive machine now but the difference is crazy. i cook most nights, i've been going to the gym 4-5 times a week, and have got further learning then ever before. i stay consistent and track everything with the tool on my profile. and i sleep so much better because i'm actually tired instead of that weird exhausted and wired feeling from sitting all day. 

the weekends i'll definitely crash and watch stuff but it's different when it's a choice and even my weekends are a bit more productive like I have started going on walks. that small decision to change one minor thing has now changed the way i feel. if you're stuck in the same loop just try not sitting down for 3 days when you get home. do literally anything else first. even if it's just walking around your place for 10 minutes or rinsing your face with cold water.",524,17,2025-11-06T22:57:11+00:00,https://reddit.com/r/selfimprovement/comments/1oqdr6j/how_1_small_change_after_work_changed_the_way_my/,Negative

I’m genuinely inspired by the idea of building systems for passive income and self-improvement. But if I’m being real, the facts are simple:

1. I live with my parents.
2. My only income is social-security funds.

I don’t know if this tranquility is acceptance, denial, or just emotional burnout. Has anyone else felt this way and actually found a way out of it?

Also: I never felt happy during my childhood or when I was in school the 8-5 system never worked for me. Right now, I’m happy and grateful for how life is, but there’s a fear that it won’t stay this way forever. And yeah… nobody is coming to save me.

reddit,selfimprovement,1oqju9s,Top-Cardiologist1011,a63b667a4923c7ba,Do you think visualizing habit data actually makes you more motivated?,"So I had this weird realization yesterday. I've been religiously tracking my meditation streak for 47 days, but when I missed day 48, I felt more devastated about losing the number than actually missing the meditation itself.

It got me thinking about how much our brains respond to visual progress vs the actual habit. Like, am I meditating because it's good for me, or because I want to see that streak counter go up?

I started experimenting with different ways to track the same habit and noticed my motivation changes completely based on how the progress is displayed. A simple checkmark feels boring, but watching something actually grow or develop over time hits different.

Has anyone else noticed this? Do you think visualizing habit data actually rewires how we think about consistency, or are we just tricking ourselves with pretty graphics?

I'm curious if this works better for internal habits (like reflection, gratitude) vs external ones (like exercise). There's something about seeing abstract progress become concrete that feels almost magical.",9,12,2025-11-07T03:31:03+00:00,https://reddit.com/r/selfimprovement/comments/1oqju9s/do_you_think_visualizing_habit_data_actually/,Positive

Lately I started staying consistent with these mindset hacks which really helped me change the way I think and act, also changing my outcomes. work wise, better opportunities and on the personal front, more confidence to go out and meet people + a better view on relationships.

  
**1. Your mind is a mirror - look at the reflection once in a while** \-  I never took a second to pause and ""reflect"" on this. We look at our phase in the mirror every day, but do we ever look at what's underneath? I started being more conscious of this. Now daily I try to journal, reflect on my day / thoughts and incorporate one mindfulness challenge a day. My new favorite is Aavaaz (mini challenges through storyflow games that keep your mind positive and sharp), but my OGs are also Headspace and an old fashioned notebook and pen.

**2. What you feed your mind is what it becomes** \- I was big on negative self-talk which I didn't realize was subconsciously shaping my thoughts and my reality. I started to feed my mind with only positive, uplifting phrases and saw my world shift. Even if things were going terrible, I still try to keep my mind focused on the ""lesson"" or silver lining positivity.

**3. It doesn't always have to be positive - we are human -** when I started this self-improvement journey, i kept pushing myself to be positive all the time. it was fake and it was super unrealistic. Especially when it comes to trying to be in a new relationship, faking happy is not healthy. We are human and we all have low days. I started to be more patient with myself and understand that my journey to improve my mind starts with being kind to it <3 it's not always rainbows and sunshine and sometimes, it's okay just to be a negative nancy and have a bit of a bad day!! 

this helped me and I help it helps you all in some way :) Journaling and sharing my experience has been cathartic (even though i'm still a huge work in progress)

I have severe health anxiety which makes me avoid doctors like the plague (lol, pun intended) because I am scared they will find something terribly wrong with me. 

I saw this doctor recently opened her practice and promoted that she provides compassionate care, like instead of paper gowns, you get a bathrobe. And, when you’re meeting with her, you meet in a comfortable office, in the clothes you came in, instead of being half naked as they talk to you.

She spent AN HOUR with me at our first appointment. She diagnosed me with high blood pressure and was very kind about it, rather than shaming me for letting my health get this bad. 

I have since already improved my blood pressure with the help of medication and limiting sodium in my diet. I have also been inspired to try a new kind of therapy, got a personal trainer, and started walking everyday. 

I’m finally taking care of myself because this doctor believed in me and told me I deserve to feel good.

A few weeks ago I decided to buy an alarm, just the cheapest $9 alarm clock on Amazon. It has been an incredible change to my day.

I don't keep my phone in my room when I go to sleep, and wake up to the worst beeps ever, but its so much better than the alternative. I'll admit it, I honestly had forgotten what it was like to not be in bed the first hour of the day.

Now I have to stand up, physically get out of bed and flip the alarm switch.

Sometimes I still do get on my phone in the mornings. That being said, the incremental difference of having to get up and take action before anything else has made a world of difference. 

I've noticed I don't feel as trapped to the phone throughout the day anymore, just by not instantly delving into an algorithm as soon as I wake up.

I've been working at the same fast food job for 4 years now and have only moved up once to a trainer role. It's been stable and I didn't really mind it, but about 6 months ago I was demoted back down to the entry position.

I really can't defend myself for their reasoning, about the 3rd year in, I really started to not care about the job anymore, most of the coworkers who I was really close with left and the whole atmosphere changed, so I let that affect my performance. 

I've always been pretty lazy, I've always put off school assignments till the last minute, and even then sometimes I wouldn't get em done.

I will say, though, that during college there were a lot of classes where I did go out of my comfort zone and tried to things that were productive (produce my own short, write my own short, etc.), but, again, for the most part I was just sort of coasting.

Since graduating I've been constantly sending out applications to get into the film/tv field in basically any way, shape, or form and have gotten zero responses (which is to be expected given the time frame), but I still feel lost.

I was thinking of switching from my current job to another entry-level job just to change things, but I feel like leaving that place after 4 years with no real leadership role to take away from it makes me feel like I wasted 4 years to learn something valuable. So now, I'm just in this indecisive position of whether to find another job and leave or stay and try and work my way back up to the trainer position and maybe even to a shift lead.

reddit,selfimprovement,1oq29kd,Lonely-Weekend582,c3929077dacb0a6e,I'm 25 years old and I feel like my life can't get better (Terminal illness and mental health),"My life was promising, I went to community college to get an associates in computer science. Then, I transfered to a cheap state school to finish up a bachelors in computer science. I had a 4.0 GPA for my first 3 years of studying. I had one year left of my bachelors where I would be taking 4 graduate level classes so that I would only require one year after graduation to get my masters in computer science. The problem at this point is that, due to a lot of circumstances, I was living in an apartment that was one hour from my school with my girlfriend. So, I had to pay rent, utilities, food, gas, car, etc , etc. 

That situation was working fine as I had a generous scholarship and I was working part time at Walmart throughout the semester. As the spring semester of my junior year came to a close I asked my manager to give me full time hours so that I could afford life over the summer. At this point he told me that there would be no hours and that I should look for another job...this was weird, but I took his advice trusting that he had my best interest in mind considering  he was dating my sister. So, i got a new job. And so it turns out there were hours and he just wanted me gone so that no one could claim favortism. 

So I got a warehouse job. The pay was okay and i would eventually become a permanent employee which would allow me to take an educational break to finish up my last year. Well, well, they heard that this was my plan. So they pushed back the date that they would make me a permanent employee past my semester  start date. So, i had to postpone my semester. 

A whole bunch of other stuff happened: my cat needing his leg amputated, my girlfriend breaking up with me and leaving me alone with rent, trauma, family making me the black sheep for seeking mental health treatment, and getting into a very toxic back and forth relationship. This made me nearly lose my job, and well mental health is mental health so that was bad. 

A year ago I got diagnosed  with Huntington Disease which basically means my brain is slowly destroying itself until I die from it. I also got diagnosed with OCD, BPD, and other mental health conditions. So that further complicated matters. 

I tried to finish up my coursework during fall 2024...I completed 4 classes, but due to my job not giving me hours I ended up in significant credit card debt. Then spring 2025 I tried to do classes part time while working, but this proved too much for my mental health. Now i am in a situation where I am barely surviving...i can barely work due to my mental health. I am being treated, I'm on 5 different meds, I am doing therapy, and I am trying my best. But, put very simply, I don't see a way out of this. I need to file for bankruptcy, I have 9 credits left of my bachelors, I have no realistic plan on how to finish my bachelors with my mental health and financial constraints. 

Then, even if I finish my bachelors, the tech field is a mess right now...i do not know how i am supposed to juggle applying to hundreds of jobs with working a full time job all through my mental health. And with each year that passes I'll be less and less capable due to my terminal illness...i do not know what to do. I very badly want to get a decent job and have a decent  rest of my life...but I have no idea how.

I really need some honest advice. I’m trying hard to stay consistent with my online studies but I keep failing again and again.

# My Daily Goal

I try to attend and focus on **7 hours of online lectures** every day for two subjects — **Subject A** and **Subject B**.  
I plan everything out in advance and tell myself *“Today I’ll definitely do it.”*  
But somehow, it never works out the way I want.

# What I’ve Tried

* ✅ **Pomodoro Technique** – Tried studying in small focused sessions, but I still end up losing focus.
* 🔄 **Subject Switching Method** – Tried alternating between subjects to keep it interesting, but the energy still drops.
* 🧠 **Motivational videos** – They work for a few hours, then I’m back to square one.

# The Problem

Even if I manage to complete my full 7-hour plan **one day**, the **next day I completely lose the motivation and energy** to do it again.  
It feels like I burn out instantly.

# My Bad Habits

I think these habits are silently destroying my focus:

* 📱 Watch **YouTube/Instagram shorts** mindlessly.
* 🔞 When stress builds up, I go to **porn** instead of dealing with it.
* 💭 Sometimes I **daydream for 30–40 minutes**, imagining random things instead of actually studying.

# How I Feel

It’s frustrating because I *really want* to study and improve my life.  
But every day I end up wasting time, feeling guilty, and restarting the same cycle the next morning.

# What I Need Help With

* How can I **build energy** to study after long online lectures?
* How can I **stop these distractions** (shorts, porn, daydreaming)?
* How do I **build consistency** — not just one day, but every day?

Any advice from people who have gone through this and found a way out would mean a lot 🙏

I want to get on track to being on top of my work, health, social life, and career. I'm thinking I need to do small things daily and I want to do that.

Now here is my question to you, what is it in your life that you have done that has helped you become better that yesterday? What are the things you focus on to improve on yourself, and what are your tips and tricks to becoming that better version of yourself. 

For me I believe if I fix my sleep schedule and start listening to the voice that tells me ""just get up and do the thing"" that everything will slowly mend itself, but i have a fear even that won't be enough.

this week, i started looking up stories of famous figure skaters who started at 18, hoping to find some encouragement. but honestly, i just feel disappointed in myself. i wish i could improve faster, be in better shape, or that i’d been more determined as a kid, maybe begged my parents for skating classes when i was 8.

recently, i bought a pair of rollerblades and started practicing at home. i know they’re not the same, but it’s the closest i can get to figure skating right now since rink fees are expensive, i don’t own figure skates, and the rink is far away.

reddit,selfimprovement,1op3b44,Rare_Sundae_3826,d2fdb084ae35b634,You're not lazy. Your brain is just fried.,"For most of my life I've had this complete lack of motivation, brain fog and exhaustion. I struggled to get out of bed, study or focus on anything important. Literally all I could do was sit in my chair and scroll through hours of social media.

I thought I had ADHD or was just lazy and tried every gimmick, hack, book or even meds. But nothing made a difference.

Then, a friend suggested a different perspective. He suggested that rather than labeling myself as lazy or adhd, consider the possibility that my phone, and those hours of mindless scrolling were frying my brain.

He mentioned it was giving my brain quick and easy artificial 'highs' so it had no reason to work harder for more meaningful ones. By scrolling I was rewarding myself BEFORE doing hard things instead of after, so of course I had no motivation to do anything.

So I made it my mission to change and reduced my phone time from over 7 hours a day to just one.

The result was unbelievable. I woke up with actual energy and stopped procrastinating. My attention span went from goldfish-level to actually functional. When your brain isn't constantly seeking the next hit, it's easier to just do the thing in front of you. For the first time, I went out of my way to study, workout and bond with family / friends.

Reducing my screen time wasn't easy at all, but here's some things that helped me the most:

I set a screentime goal everyday and tracked it with simple wall calendar. Every morning I put a big 'X' if I was under the goal. Seeing the chain of X's was so satisfying and became a visual proof of progress.

I stopped using my phone at the gym, on public transport, or during meals. By sitting with boredom I trained my brain to be comfortable without constant hits of stimulation.

Make it very hard to use addicting apps. Atm im using Breaktime Focus App Blocker to block my Instagram and Tiktok 24/7. Every time I want to use it, it makes me wait 15 seconds and most times I put the phone back down. If not, it makes me set a time limit and reblocks it after to hold me accountable. Theres a lot out there so find one that works for you.

I made a list of low-stimulation activities that still feel good: walking, gyming reading, cooking, calling friends. When I'm tempted to scroll, I pick from this list instead and found that it gave me the same 'happy' feeling that scrolling did.

Kept my mornings phone free. I put my phone in a room, drawer or I literally put it in a tissue box and throw it across the room before bed. Don't burn all your day's motivation as soon as you wake up.

Cutting back on my phone addiction was definitely hard but I wanted to share just how big of an impact its had.

It was years ago I should be over it but I'm not. I still look for her and her group every time there's a possibility of me seeing them. A few years back, I got bullied by this group of girls. The reason was the ""head"" group of them had a crush on me and would get angry with me often. I don't remember much of this time and to this day I don't understand why she was so infatuated with me (I was rly ugly and very quiet) however one of the girls who was a part of the bullying was a childhood friend of mine. 

Really, we used to be very close but then before I knew it she was gone. After a full year of isolation and bullying, I left that school. That's the backstory. 

But once a year at a state competition, I see her and the group of girls. Last year she won an award and this year she's competing in a higher level than me. How can someone who hurt me so badly be doing so well? I used to be a vindictive person. I enjoyed hurting people and getting revenge, but with some therapy I'm not anymore. But I'd be lying if I said I didn't think about it. Why is she better? Why is she so unaffected? Why am I still afraid? 

  
Should I pray on her downfall? Should I want to succeed for the sole reason of being better than her? Should I ignore it and live how I do now, fooling myself into thinking that I'm better off because I'm happier and she's successful. I'm neither happier or successful; I just lost.

reddit,selfimprovement,1oqaosg,Muneerr,182f7fc0b4fb02b9,When you feel small seeing others do better,"

Lately I’ve been noticing this thing about myself. Whenever I come across someone who’s really good at what they do, I start to feel small. Like today, I’m playing pickleball with this guy who’s just ruthless. He’s sharp, confident, and fully focused. I’m just there to have fun, but once the game starts I feel tense and my mind starts saying stuff like “he’s so much better than me, I don’t even belong here.” Then every mistake feels huge, like proof that I shouldn’t even be playing. It’s not that he’s being rude or showing off, he’s just doing his thing. The problem is in how I see myself. The same thing happens at work. When I see someone who’s confident and doing really well, I start comparing. I wonder how they’re so good, how they manage to stay composed all the time. And then I kind of shut down and feel inferior. I stop talking to them or avoid them altogether as if they are superior to me, like they’re on a different level and I don’t belong.

After noticing this pattern over and over, I took a step back to figure out why I feel this way. I started reflecting and reading, and what I found makes sense. A lot of it comes down to social comparison. It’s normal to compare ourselves to others, but when I keep looking at people who seem “better,” it just feeds into that sense of being less than. Then it turns into this inferiority thing, where I convince myself other people are naturally better or more deserving. Sometimes it even feels like impostor syndrome, that voice that says “you don’t really belong here, they’re going to figure you out.”

I also realized I project my own insecurities onto people. I assume they’re judging me or looking down on me, when really it’s just me doing that to myself. And to protect myself, I end up avoiding those people or situations altogether, which only makes it worse. The funny thing is, sometimes I later find out the person I was so intimidated by isn’t even above me. I was once amazed by someone giving a presentation in my office that I had the same feeling that he is superior just to find out that he is a junior in other team. Sometimes they’re people who are newer, or struggling with their own stuff. That part always hits hard because it shows how much of it was just in my head.

So now I’m trying to handle it differently. When those feelings come up, I try to appreciate what the other person’s doing instead of comparing. I remind myself that their success doesn’t take away from mine. I try to stay curious, like maybe I can learn something from them instead of feeling threatened. I remind myself that I’m allowed to be learning, that nobody starts great, and that people who are really good now just kept showing up.

Confidence, I’m starting to see, isn’t about never feeling insecure. It’s about how you deal with it when it happens. I’m trying to stay in those moments instead of running from them. To keep showing up, to respect myself enough not to quit just because someone else is ahead.

People who are great at what they do didn’t get there by accident. They worked, failed, learned, and kept going. I can do that too. I’m learning to give myself that same respect, to stop letting those thoughts control me. I might not be there yet, but I’m getting better at not letting that feeling decide my worth.",2,0,2025-11-06T20:56:50+00:00,https://reddit.com/r/selfimprovement/comments/1oqaosg/when_you_feel_small_seeing_others_do_better/,Positive

I (18 NB) just had a friend confront me about my behaviors and how it's affecting them. After some self reflection, I have realized that I am, quite frankly, a really shitty and deeply manipulative person, to the point I was convincing myself I wasn't so bad. I want to work on myself so that I don't hurt more people in the future.

Some things I want to work on include:

1. I lie very easily. It started with lying to my parents about my grades, and I just haven't stopped since. It has become natural to me and I catch myself doing it unintentionally all the time. I also withhold information from people, both intentionally and not, all the time. For example, I told a friend an elaborate lie about my parents heavily restricting my internet access as a child, when they actually did the opposite. I think I do this because I like avoiding my problems and conflict at all costs, but I can't explain lies like the example I just gave.

2. Ghosting. I currently have several missed phone calls from my parents, and I am ghosting a scholarship foundation giving me a life changing amount of money. I also frequently ghost on dating apps for no apparent reason.

3. Gossiping is a huge issue of mine. I often don't think before I speak, and I betray the people who trust me. Additionally, I do not confront people when I have a problem with them, and instead tell other people. 

4. I am very impulsive. I spend money I know I can't, I get drunk when I know I'll make bad decisions when intoxicated, I say things without thinking and betray people's trust, etc.

The reason I was confronted in the first place was because I got nearly blackout drunk and sent a regretful text that I feel incredibly guilty about. I want to stop behaviors like this and also get to the root of the issue. I started therapy last month for unrelated reasons (adhd and anxiety), and I don't know how to bring this up.

I struggle pretty heavily with self esteem, depression, avoidance, and being ok with my gender identity. I think all of this contributes to my behavior, but I genuinely have no idea where to start or what to do.

Even those who initially showed up to comfort me very soon started asking me for favors, guidance, advice and wanted me to be back to my old role of a giver asap.

Now I was not only dealing with a death of a family member and loss of a job and a childhood pet, I was also becoming painfully aware of the role I was playing in other people’s lives, my overgiving patterns, and I couldn’t unsee it. 

All this time I was a Robin or Alfred to someone’s Batman movie, a sweet beautiful innocent soul who can never do anything wrong. Suddenly when I couldn’t be that anymore I was quickly labeled as cold, bitter, jealous, jaded, negative. Maybe I was that too, but for the first time I gave myself the permission to not be ok and break down for once. I felt unappreciated and very taken for granted and angry. Imagine being there, supporting, helping, guiding, only to receive these labels after so many years and so much time and effort you put in other people. I was heartbroken. 

I couldn’t ignore this anymore and started naturally settling boundaries because I was too emotionally exhausted and I just couldn’t deal with people even if I wanted to. One by one, my friends and family started testing my boundaries like never before, some tried to put me down. Some just slowly faded away and distanced themselves.

For the first time in my life I have to choose myself, even if that means being alone for a while. It hurts like hell. I don’t know what the future brings. I just know that I’ve seen my role and I’ve seen other people’s roles as clear as a day, and for the first time in my life I realized that I actually do deserve to be loved and cared for too. I have the right not to feel ok. I don’t have to be strong all the time. I can be imperfect. I am allowed to need support too. I can have negative emotions. I am allowed to put myself first.

They say we choose people and teach them how to treat us. I don’t think that’s entirely true when you are young and unaware of your subconscious patterns. Until you see it and recognize it you don’t choose it, it’s a default setting. And I was for the first time becoming acutely aware of my patterns and my history of minimizing myself, parentification, emotional neglect…

this finally made me realize that I have no other choice but to take responsibility for myself and start consciously choosing better. Ironically, these losses made me realize that not only I deserve to be loved and treated with respect and appreciation, but also that I am a genuinely decent person and I took many of my good qualities for granted and gave my best to people who didn’t even deserve half of it.

Just wanted to share this I guess

reddit,selfimprovement,1opw9sl,Sea-Development-5088,b321e39960dcef30,What Else Can I Do? - Still Feeling Low After Years of Self Improvement,"Hi guys,

I'll try to keep this fairly brief. Thank you for taking the time to read.

For around 10 years now, I have been suffering, to varying degrees, with depression, DP/DR and at some points some quite bad anxiety (but mainly low mood/anhedonia/dysthymia/dissociation). I have ADHD too, diagnosed when I was 23. I have no trauma or any troubled past - I think my life with depression was just triggered by a break up I had when I was 19 (which I blamed myself for), and since then it's like my mind has just 'learned' what depression is and has never really let it go. 

I've tried everything to combat this and I have a very healthy lifestyle. I run 50k (32 miles) a week and belong to a great running club which is like a community, I weight lift twice a week, I walk with my dog twice a day, I avoid ultra processed food, try to limit caffeine intake, I take vitamin b12, iron, zinc and creatine, I try to avoid screen time as much as possible and I barely go on Instagram/Facebook, etc, I have a very stable and easy-going job, happy relationship with wife, baby and pets. I've also done journaling and CBT, but haven't found these too useful - mainly because I don't have too many negative thoughts to challenge and no trauma to discuss. I've also done a month's worth of TDCS - that didn't work either unfortunately.

I'm pescetarian, but my diet is good and varied. I try to get a lot of protein in as well as supplementing with b12 and iron, and try to eat fish for lunch at least a few times a week.

I've tried numerous supplements with little to no success apart from St John's Wort for a month or so a few years back, only to have it stop working for me thereafter. Turmeric, Saffron, L-Tyrosine, Creatine, Fish Oil, Magnesium, etc. I've tried it all and no joy. I've been on antidepressants which have worked when I'm feeling very low and got me out of a hole, but most have failed to work when I'm just feeling moderately and consistently low. 

I try to meditate but my ADHD makes this very hard. I find it quite nice to do in the moment, but I don't notice much of a benefit from it. 

I've also had blood tests done for iron, b12, creatinine, testosterone, etc, but nothing has come back with any flags. 

If you guys can recommend ANYTHING else, please let me know. I'm willing to try most things :) ",2,7,2025-11-06T11:18:38+00:00,https://reddit.com/r/selfimprovement/comments/1opw9sl/what_else_can_i_do_still_feeling_low_after_years/,Positive

I don’t really know what I’m doing or where I’m headed. No roadmap, no clear goal. I want to work and grind, but I don’t even know where to start or what my goal is. There’s so much info everywhere it just makes me feel like I’m behind.

Here’s where I’m at rn: • Learned video & photo editing (Premiere Pro, Photoshop). Made a few small projects but never had the ideas or resources to build a real portfolio. • Tried Blender 3D, made some cool stuff but it didn’t feel like my thing. • Been learning Python and done small projects like calculators, weather apps, rock-paper-scissors, etc (probably 20+). I’ve covered basics, OOP, recursion, DSA, but I can’t seem to build bigger or more creative projects yet. Feels like I’m stuck in that beginner phase.

I thought about web dev, but with AI doing so much backend/frontend/API stuff now, I’m not sure it’s a smart long-term move. Feels too saturated, and AI’s only gonna get better at it. (If I’m wrong, lmk. Open to being corrected.)

Stuff I’m considering rn: • Cybersecurity • Software Engineering • AI / ML / Deep Learning / Data Science • UI/UX Design (maybe with graphic design)

If you guys know other solid paths I should look into, please drop them.

Some context: • My A Level grades were pretty bad, so getting into a good uni might be hard. • I’ve thought about studying abroad (maybe?), but I don’t know how the process works and it’s expensive. • It’s already November and I feel like time’s slipping away.

I just wanna start earning something, even small. I need that spark again to feel like I’m building momentum instead of wasting time.

Please help a young brother out. I’ll appreciate genuine advice or constructive criticism.

TLDR: 18M on gap year, wasted most of it. Learned Python & editing but still a beginner. Don’t know what career path to focus on (Cybersec, AI, SE, UI/UX etc). A Level grades are bad, not sure if I should stay local or apply abroad (no clue how).

Stopped asking for time, love, affection, everything. And I wasn’t bothered by it. I actually remember being so happy when I got the house to myself, just me and the drinking. I was always choosing the bottle over her. She felt it every time and made sure I felt it too, and I did but never really got bothered by it because I was numbed out.. But lately, things are different. She's started including me in her weekend plans again. In fact I would feel horrible if she wouldn’t include me.

For example, I open youtube and in my head im like “no you’ll waste hours. Go outside and take a walk”, and I focus on it. I push as hard as I can. “Just do it. do it now” but then I just keep watching youtube. This applies to every moment of my life with a variety of vices.

I dont make excuses either. I never say “I’ll do it later”. I never say “It’s my cheat day” or “ive earned it” or something like that. I’m not depressed. I believe I am in control. I never blame external forces. I’m not afraid of failure or rejection. Im not mean to myself. I dont have anxiety. I never think any thought that supports or justifies “laziness” genuinely.

People may say ADHD or something but 8 years ago I was so productive no problem. Woke up early to workout, no bad habits that I struggled to quit, excelled in school and socially. I was doing a lot of stuff and never felt like I had to “fight myself” to do any of it. Unless ADHD is just something you can develop, also I dont know why it would have gotten so much worse over the past few years.

Ive considered devices are brain rotting me, but even during my hyper-productive years I spent a lot of time on devices same apps as now. Never struggled to stop when I knew I needed to.

reddit,selfimprovement,1op33hg,McLOVINfromHonolulu,0eac645683d619ce,Can trauma become a positive thing?,"This might sound counterintuitive, but I’ve been thinking a lot about whether trauma — while painful and destructive — can also lead to unexpected growth or even new skills.

There’s that old saying, “what doesn’t kill you makes you stronger,” and while it’s often overused, I’ve noticed that some people do come out of difficult experiences with heightened awareness, resilience, or analytical skills. For example, someone who grew up in a volatile environment might develop strong emotional intelligence or an ability to read subtle social cues as a survival mechanism. Later in life, those same skills might help them excel in leadership, therapy, or creative work.

I’m not trying to glorify trauma or say that it’s “good.” It’s obviously not — no one should need to suffer to grow. But I do wonder: is there something about surviving trauma that forces the brain to adapt, to think differently, or to become more self-aware?

Psychology sometimes calls this post-traumatic growth — the idea that people can experience positive psychological change as a result of struggling with adversity. That might mean a deeper appreciation for life, stronger relationships, or a sharper sense of purpose.

So I wanted to ask the community:
Have you ever noticed positive changes or skills that emerged because of a traumatic experience?

Do you think trauma can genuinely lead to growth, or is it more about how we choose to process it afterward?

I’d wake up ready to “get things done,” open my laptop, and suddenly end up lost, new task apps, productivity hacks, and endless planning cycles. By noon, I’d feel busy but had accomplished nothing real.

I thought I was just lazy or bad at focus. But one night, my fiancée said something that completely changed how I looked at it.
She said, “You’re not struggling with motivation, you’re struggling with clarity.”

And she was right.
Most days, I started working without knowing what I really wanted from the day. I wasn’t lazy, I was just mentally cluttered. My brain didn’t know where to go.

So we tried something different.
Before starting anything, she’d ask me a few simple questions:

What’s the actual goal here?

What’s blocking you right now?

What do you already know that you’re ignoring?


It sounds small, but those few questions changed everything.
I stopped wasting time trying to “get motivated.” I didn’t need motivation, I needed direction. Once I had that, I moved fast.

That clarity-first approach completely rebuilt how I work. I finish things faster, think straighter, and don’t drown in “productivity systems” anymore.

We even turned that idea into a small AI project that helps people do the same, finding clarity before doing the work.
If you want to try it, it’s called Contrika ai.

Clarity did more for my productivity than any hack, tool, or habit ever did.
I’m curious, how do you bring clarity into your day before you start working?",5,3,2025-11-05T17:08:56+00:00,https://reddit.com/r/selfimprovement/comments/1op8msj/youre_not_unmotivated_youre_just_unclear/,Positive

No music, no podcasts, no notifications, just silence. The first 10 minutes felt awkward, like I was missing something. But after that, my brain just slowed down.  
It’s wild how different you start to think when you’re not constantly feeding on input.

Now I do it every few days - 30 mins, sometimes even an hour, no phone, no destination. It’s become my reset button.

Curious if anyone else does this kind of thing or if you’ve found your own “mini reset” routine that actually works.

reddit,selfimprovement,1opl0vt,forthese2,703828d7084d6295,I'm just so lost and hopeless I don't see a way out. Hopeless & useless,"I'm a 27 year old fuck up with nothing to show but addictions. Ever since I was a kid I was told I was extremely clever and intelligent, never believed it. Wanted to quit school at the age of 15 but for the sake of my parents finished college and then uni, completing my masters in investment banking 4 years ago. That is all I have to show for myself. I've always been lazy, unambitious, I have no interests. Come to think of it it seems I've always struggled with similar behaviours, just in different forms and different extents. As a child I always struggled with picking the skin around my fingers, they were always cut and bleeding. Then in my early teens I became addicted to a friendship, I call it addicted now knowing the definition of an addict. Eventually becoming addicted to my boyfriend and relationship, one filled with anxiety & trauma which manifested in the form of crippling OCD, to the point where I had to quit my job as I was stacking shelves but could only pair things in even numbers. Could only use certain perfumes or drink certain juice flavours otherwise something awful will happen to a family member. 

I managed to get out of that rut fortunately (still deal with OCD but in different forms), just to fall into a deeper hole of gambling. This was during my second year at uni. Long story short, fast forward to now: a crippling gambling addict, every penny to the bookies, and an uncurable dermatillomania and trichotillomania issue. So 90% of the time my face is filled with scabs, my long beautiful lashes are non existent, my pockets are empty. All because of my own stupid doing. 

Oh not to mention that I'm a weed addict, of course, how could I not be? For the last 4 years I have been high for the majority of my days. Last year, every day, multiple joints. Not a problem youd say? Well I can't eat, sleep, move or do anything if I don't smoke. Once I do I am stuck in my head with all of these goals and ambitions that I will fulfil and work towards once sober. But of course once sober I'm stuck there, the lazy slob I am. 

I am really at my wits end. I see no way out. I can't change my life. I sit in bed all day can't be bothered to even move and eat. I eat one meal a day if I can be bothered. I'm surprised my body still functions. I smoke more than I eat. I pick at my skin for hours and hours, I pick at my lashes all day until I tweeze them out. I'm so fed up. I see no way out. No money, nothing. The only thing that brings me joy is shopping, of course I can't as all my money goes to the bookies. I just want to cry all the time. Even when I'm outside I can't be presently happy in the moment, because I just keep thinking what is the point of all of this? 

I don't know what the point of this post is. Just some encouraging words maybe? I say this and then feel like I'm wasting everyones time because knowing my loser self I won't take any of the help on board will I. Sigh.

I couldn’t manage my personal relationships, I was losing friends, romantic relationships… I was demanding and addicted to drama.

And just when I hit bottom, I finally did what I’d heard so many times:
I started to only consume “happy entertainment.”

I stopped watching the news. Stopped the scary movies, violent shows, and serial killer documentaries.

I stopped listening to sad, blaming songs, the “you broke my heart,” “it’s your fault” kind of songs.
At first, it was so hard.

I didn’t realize how addicted my brain was to suffering, to the chaos, the drama, the darkness.
It was like a drug. I was chasing dopamine in all the wrong places.

But after a few weeks, something shifted.
Peace started to show up.
My thoughts got lighter.
My reactions calmer.

It’s been 5 years now, and I can honestly tell you, start cutting off the “suffering material” now.

Watch movies that inspire you.
Laugh before you sleep.
Listen to happy music.

Your life will start to change almost immediately.

reddit,selfimprovement,1op3l0f,Specific_Wish1051,7c06f3504a2cc659,I want to stop impulsively seeking out information about celebrities. Advice?,"I have been working on my relationship with my phone, social media, and technology for several years. I've since deleted most of my social media, besides Reddit and Youtube. I have News Feed Blockers on these two sights to minimise screen time.

However, beginning during COVID, I started to develop an ""interest"" in celebrity culture, initially thanks to Instagram's ""for you"" page (before I deleted the app). I put ""interest"" in quotation marks because I don't actually consider it an interest, just a sort of morbid curiosity. There is something in me that wants to feed on the gossip and drama, perhaps.

Growing up, I was *never* interested in celebrity culture. I was turned off by it, even. I remember seeing *People* magazines at the supermarket as a kid and just being put off by the disingenuous and attention seeking headlines, and wondering why people bought those types of magazines. Now, I've had to block *People*'s website, and even though Reddit is one of the only ""social media"" sites I have, I seek out celebrity gossip here. 

It feels vapid and like brain rot, and I end up wasting hours reading this shit, and then I think about how I could have been playing my instrument, or reading, or learning to draw, etc. Rather than educating myself on important issues, or working to improve myself, my relationships, and the world around me, I just...waste time reading about people I will never meet and do not admire.

reddit,selfimprovement,1op8xb5,roborbiettino,be3a1c6b2aeeccf7,I'm so insecure.,"I don't even really know how to make this post, I think I'm just kinda rambling.

I'm so insecure about my looks. I feel genuinely disgusting. I'm not fat, I'm actually pretty skinny and my bf% is low. I still can't stand to look at my face. I feel like my bones are straight up fucked.
Thin eyebrows. Really large forehead thats probably going to get worse if I (oh god no) start balding. Small chin. My jaw is on the thinner end. My eyebrows are thin. My eyes are ight ig, but I don't really like those either. I'm 17 and people often mistake me for younger. My skin tends to break-out even if I do skincare, which is noticeable since I'm naturally really pale.

I can't look at myself in the mirror and it's been like this for years. I've done all that basic shit, haircuts yadayada. I had (one) (mildly) attractive girl be kinda into me and that still didn't help me feel any prettier exp since it didn't result in anything, so I don't think being desired by others would fix it.

What is wrong with me. I don't even know who I see when I look in the mirror, I don't know if what I'm seeing is the truth, I don't know if I'm a 2/10 or a 3/10 or a 1/20 or a 5. Some dudes called me a 7 once I couldn't believe them. And I still just can't like myself.

How am I supposed to? I see so, so many beautiful people out there. I'm just not them. I never will be. I can't manage to post pictures of myself and when my friends do I always feel sick reposting them. ""wah but the people on social media use filters and"" it's irl too. And I tried the filters and lighting and stuff I'm still not ONE bit close to them. I don't think I can do this much longer, and I don't know how I could ever deal with worsening in the future. 

Like I think I could genuinely consider suicide if I started balding or something. I just can't win. I don't understand why someone would want to be around me, much less in a relationship with me. And that results in me occasionally being worse to other people. I feel like a horrible person and I don't think my life is worth living like this. I occasionally have small sparks of confidence but it never lasts.

Always back to square one, somehow. And the worst thing is I can't even bring myself to lower my standards (looks wise) for others, And I feel like such a dick when I do so, I feel like I'm projecting my own lack of attractiveness onto others and it makes me feel terrible every time. As if I was contributing to the system iykwim. 

I just wish I could be hot for one day. I just wish I could live my life as an attractive person. But I can't. I keep trying to distract myself but it's not helping. I feel unattractive to myself, to everyone around me, and to the opposite gender. As a whole. 

I never had experience either, like I'm 17 I barely had my 1st kiss. One. At 17. Why would a woman want that. What value could I ever bring. None. I can't be showed around to people, I don't come out well in pictures, I can't connect properly, I'm inexperienced, I'm not valuable.

reddit,selfimprovement,1ooszdw,dersneij,3e9c83e513da016e,"""I hate myself, but i'm better than everyone""","
I’ve been seeing a lot of people say things like “I hate myself, but I’m still better than everyone,” or ""I have a lot of self-hatred, but i still think i'm better than everyone else"" and it made me think, at first it sounded like pure contradiction or just a big ego, but after thinking about it more and doing some reading, I came across the idea of the “real self” and the “ideal self” and honestly i think that’s the only explanation that really fits

The “real self” is who you actually are, your flaws, your past, the parts of you that you don’t always like to face, the “ideal self” is who you wish you were, the version that’s confident, capable, and untouchable, when those two versions drift too far apart, your mind starts to fight itself, that’s when people can feel both worthless and superior at the same time

It’s not that they’re being arrogant it’s that their mind is trying to protect them from the reality, the self-hatred comes from the real self seeing its flaws, while the pride or superiority comes from the ideal self trying to make up for the pain, It’s like an emotional shield that keeps the person from completely collapsing

For example, imagine being in an argument or a fight where you freeze up or don’t know how to respond, the real self feels weak and embarrassed, but the mind creates an alternate version that says corny shq like “I could have destroyed them if I wanted.” and i think it's just your brain trying to restore balance after feeling powerless

The same thing happens in social situations. Someone who feels ignored might think, “Everyone here is fake or dumb.”

My question here is, if anyone has another explanation for this or a different opinion please say it to me, i want to see all the perspectives

The idea isn't mine btw, it's from 'Carl Rogers' and sorry if there are any grammatical errors.

I’ve been drowning in work, in stress, in thoughts I couldn’t even name. Somewhere along the way, I started to pull back from everyone. I didn’t want to talk, I didn’t want to join meals, I didn’t want to be involved in any noise or interaction.

It wasn’t anger. Just… exhaustion.
Noise started to irritate me. Conversations felt heavy. I began to enjoy being alone more than being with the people I care about. I found comfort in anime, movies, silence, isolation. The idea of sitting at the table and talking felt like an emotional marathon. I started skipping family gatherings. I avoided events. I stayed in my room. I thought that distance was safer, easier, quieter.

But today was different.

I don’t know how it happened. Maybe it was the smell of food, maybe someone made a small joke, or maybe my heart was finally tired of being tired. I sat with them. I talked a little. Then I laughed. It was small at first, then real.

And it felt warm.
Warm in a way I honestly forgot I could feel.

I’m not “better.” I know one good moment doesn’t magically fix the heaviness I’ve been carrying. But it was something. A soft reminder that connection isn’t always overwhelming, and that I haven’t fully lost the part of me that enjoys just being with my family.

Today, I laughed with them.
And for the first time in a while… I was happy.

My faint memory is being locked up in a beige room from early morning to late evening studying, without meeting any teachers. Tbe last few hours feeling physically ill about the idea of going back home and getting panic attacks. Then going back in the dark back home and well it wasn’t sweet at home either. From what I remember I wasn’t allowed to join the Christmas activities in school. What added to it was that the 24th my family was so poor that they didn’t have money to have an actual Christmas. So we just opened gifts and like always jt was a very abusive atmoshere.

I have autism so going after traditions was always important for me, and that year I didn’t get any of my usual traditions, after that its been very very hard for me to pick up the cozy comforting feeling around autumn and winter.

I easily feel lonely and puke ready (?). But I really want a change this year, so please give me some recommendations.

(Wanna say that this seasonal depression affected me so bad that nowadays I can’t wear any type of dark clothes cause it reminds me of the dark nights going home alone. My wardrobe is only colourful clothes and my room doesnt have any black in it at all. So like crazy colourful)

There's so many people, many personalities that I look up to and some that I certainly judge. I don't know who or what I am. I mean yes as a kid and in my teen, I had that cringe phase like everyone else. But as an adult... I'm still struggling to just have my own personality or vibe. I constantly tried to be good because I want to be seen as a good person but I doubt I'm truly a good person. 

Not that I am much of a bad person either because I don't get jealousy, never want to steal because it's simply bad and I got no balls to do so. Don't even wanna think about killing anyone, let alone trying to stab myself on the finger with a needle and I almost fainted. So nope, not on my list.

I just feel like I'm such a fake person, so smiley, so polite, so mannered. But only because I just don't want to look at people's eyes and think they would hate my behaviour. I want to be free, I want to be goofy and relaxed yet calm and always think critically in the right manner. I've never once let my guard down, constantly feel like wearing a mask.

Now I have a year left in my bond, and it feels like I’m just stuck — too under-skilled to move on, too unmotivated to change, and too scared that I’ve already wasted the best years to build something. I mean if I couldn't do anything in 3 years, what can I do in 1.

I took off my headphones as soon as I entered the building, I knew from experience that having them on would give me an excuse to not talk. I made the conscious choice to sit where people were, still in the back of the classroom but not hidden like usual. 

I’d missed the first day of the semester, so I had an excuse to talk to someone, I’d ask them about what they did the first day. 

This girl was sitting in front of me, she seemed busy taking stuff out of her bag and being on her phone. I felt super nervous, she seemed super busy. What if she ignores me? What if I’m being weird and disrupting her? I sat there paralyzed for a full minute, contemplating on talking to this person. 

Eventually I stopped thinking and just moved. I leaned forward and said “Hey excuse me, can I ask you a question? I missed the first day and I was wondering if you could help me catch up on anything important”. She turned around, with a smile and a lot of enthusiasm, and told me about the course, and eventually we exchanged names. 

I felt over the moon, I did it! I made my first uni friend after 3 years of telling myself I’d talk to people. 

We kept meeting in class. Eventually she invited me to events outside of uni. I got to meet her friends, and I started going out with them. And thanks to that I met more people. This friend I made had to leave 6 months later, she was an exchange student.

But those months were more than enough for me to get the opportunity to go out, to make new friends, and to learn more about socializing and get a lot better at it. 

And 2 years later, I have my own social circle. People I met on my own. I get invites at least once a week, I have people to celebrate my birthday with. I feel so much more confident socially. All because I chose to ignore the fear and opened my mouth that one time, after 3 years of doubts, anxiety and hesitation. 

My biggest lesson: **sometimes it only takes once**. One right person, one moment of courage, and everything changes.

And I want to share this lesson with you. In those moments where you feel scared, where you hesitate to talk to that one person. Don’t let that voice stop you. The perfect moment where you won’t feel fear doesn’t exist. Just do it. **Because all it takes for your life to change is those 5 seconds of courage**. 

It took me 3 years to muster up those 5 seconds, had I done it earlier I wouldn’t have spent all that time feeling lonely, left out and depressed. I hope you can resonate with this story and my biggest hope is that it inspires you to do the same, to overcome that moment of hesitation when you are about to go up to someone. ",9,0,2025-11-04T21:57:33+00:00,https://reddit.com/r/selfimprovement/comments/1ookmvm/how_i_made_my_first_ever_friend_at_uni_after_3/,Negative

I promised myself that 2026 will be the year I'll finally meet someone, but I don't really know where to meet women as an adult as I'm not in school anymore (I do college virtually), and I work in an environment where everyone is older than me because I work a job that's unusual for someone my age to have. All my hobbies are very male-centric, so there's very rarely any women around. Because of this, I guess approaching in public is probably my best and only shot.

I've only approached twice before; first time I got the Instagram and we texted for a little bit but I could tell she wasn't interested and it went nowhere fast, and then the second time I got rejected. I have a feeling I'm probably gonna go through a couple of rejections, but realistically, I'd probably be able to get a girlfriend out of 100 approaches right?

reddit,selfimprovement,1oombl8,ProfessorAltaccount,a2ab00b31c2a2b47,The Answer You've Been Looking For,"You *want* something, don't you? I'm sure you already know the truth. Chances are, you'll *never* get all of the things you want - after all, desires aren't guaranteed. Outcomes, results, fantasies and ideals, will never be certain. You could make the right choices, live life perfectly, yet still somehow end up with nothing. So why? Why should one, be willing to play the game? 

Because it's not over. We may never be able to control fate, or force the world to bend to our childlike wishes, but that doesn't mean our capability only spans in a realm of lost hope and negativity. As autonomous beings we still have agency and influence, and with such powers there is still something, perhaps the most important thing, that our extraordinary selves can do. 

# Better our odds. 

Intelligence, Fullness, and Truth. Doing the *smart* things, the *right* things, and not letting any ability leak. Living amongst optimal conduct in every second of every moment of our lives. If you gave your **absolute** all, almost always made the correct decisions whilst holding an otherworldly zeal...What are the likelihoods in each moment your desired outcomes would increase in realization?

People often hold a misconception about human yearning. They believe it only works in tiers, like how certain things will make them satisfied, or more meaningful ones that seem out of reach fulfilled. The flaw in this thinking is in relation to variables - no matter the level of the desire, the individual's happiness, unless otherwise, is forever subjugated to a conditional factor often outside their complete control. 

It very well may be idiotic to say, but I possess the courage to express my own personal belief. I think all people who desire, when excavated to the deepest layer, crave the same magnificent thing - **To genuinely love their life.** When you consider the nature of wants, they all lead to a subjective gain. The reason this addition is valuable to the individual, is because it fuels their cause not just to live in contentment, but the way in which they do so. Even those who yearn for death typically desire a form of peace or perceived benefit/punishment that brings them closer to truly loving their own current and conceptual reality. 

With these two understandings, that one can never be fulfilled solely by a dependent variable, and that by majority a person's objective is to maximize the love they have for their lives - It's possible to determine an answer for those in search of one. We must all fall in love with the independent variable: ***Performance.*** 

No matter what we have or the environment we find ourselves in, our ability to do is undeniably loyal to us. Acting with the entirety of our being, one short of personal perfection, is the only reliable way to improve and optimize our chances of success in obtaining the things we long for, the things that would allow us to love our life more than we do or ever thought we could. And it's for that exact reason, we should admire the act of strife. Even when the end is uncertain, and the fact remains that we may *never get what we dream of*, intentional effort promises us something that dreams cannot. That we did not live a life half lived, that despite our potential disheartened lack of ideals, there were no regrets in how we worked towards them. We took a gamble, playing the game of life, risking **everything** for a future that could have made it all seem worth it.

We shall not wait for external outcomes and possessions to finally love our lives. Our infatuation must stem from conduct, the player of hope and vitality, who brings well being through an ever growing proximity. **Immerse yourself into the play of performance, and you will adore life more than most not because of what you get, but who you are and how you live.** And of course, there's always the beautiful possibility... that you overwhelm the odds, and win. 

*You want something, don't you*? Well it's about time you get it. Fortune favors the fervent, so let's go ahead and better our odds, towards a life we can fully love... together.",4,0,2025-11-04T23:02:08+00:00,https://reddit.com/r/selfimprovement/comments/1oombl8/the_answer_youve_been_looking_for/,Positive

reddit,selfimprovement,1oouwmg,hobo2166,b681ddaea5c5c7cf,Lost it On Little Brothers for the First Time,"TLDR: lost it on younger brother who's 9, scared I broke or harmed our relationship, sweared first time at him, don't want to repeat, apologized but how do I move on from feeling weird around him now. Or if he still feels weird even though he said he forgives me.

I (20yrs M) have 3 younger siblings who are all within the ages of (6-9yrs old). I recently had the first serious argument with the oldest (9 years old) where I got alot more mad than usual and kind of lost it.

I would like to think I'm a good older brother to them obv not perfect but, talking with them, knowing what they're into, buying them snacks and favourite foods. However, for some reason the last few days they were just brats or crazy sometimes, my stepdad is normally the one who disciplines them but as he travels for work no one's really there at home to do so other than me when I try. When my stepdad would discipline them though, he would occasionally swear or yell.

They like to playfight or annoy each other at times and for some reason the oldest really wanted to annoy me this time by throwing my clothes all around my room and hiding some of my clothes around the house.

  
Normally I would be fine and play along, but recently been stressed out more than usual with work, school and personal problems which made me have a lot of pent up anger. The oldest or youngest would also sometimes say things such as ""I wish you would move out"", ""My life would be better without you"" ""This is why you have no friends"".

  
And when I was about to drop the oldest to his hockey practice, going to the wrong location due to gps, and feeling the stress from my parents and life, the oldest than said he'd rather have someone else drop him off than not going, when it wasn't even really my fault. I did feel bad though as he was late to his game and in a sense my fault but I just lost it and yelled after that. 

On the car ride back home we argued as the oldest, even though 9, is pretty smart and can talk, but I do feel really bad about the argument as I said things such as that he can't do certain things in hockey, he's bad at it, needs to get better and not play roblox all day, and just said things I knew might hurt him.

  
One main thing that stuck out was me swearing for the first time to him and saying something like ""If you don't want me to drop you off than don't f*cking ask me for anything else"". 

I since than apologized, bought him snacks, and spoke to him about it and he doesn't seem too weird about it said he understands but I do feel really bad and I'm scared and feel weird around him especially if I broke a border with him now. Aslo remembering as a kid how I felt when my dad would do that and I'd feel weird around him and not able to open it up. It sucks feeling like I didn't learn from that am now repeating that cycle.

I love my brothers so much, How should I move on from this? I want to teach them things at times but not remove that idea of me being the playful fun older brother who they can always rely on which I want them to know.

Are you constantly reaching for the next quick relief, scrolling your phone, grabbing a drink, firing up Netflix, just to quiet the fatigue of stress and overwhelm?

Here’s the truth: your brain is wired for those shortcuts. But they don’t build true resilience or freedom.

In one of my articles, I dive into how stress hijacks your brain’s reward system (hello dopamine), pushing you into loops of short-term relief rather than meaningful transformation.

Come and reflect on how this pattern can keep you trapped and why something gentler, steadier, and more mindful actually holds the key.

~Do you recognise the cycle of quick fixes in your own life?

~What’s one small ritual you’re willing to swap instead?

If this resonates, drop a comment, let’s talk about real change together.

Here’s to rewiring for calm, clarity, and presence (not just survival).

reddit,stress,1on47g9,valsecchin,1e3366b976bca623,I wasted 5 years being 'busy' but broke with these tricks.,"Does your day disappear while stress takes over?

I was there for years. Endless tasks, constant anxiety, running in circles and getting nowhere. I tried every productivity hack, every stress technique, every ""life-changing system."" Nothing stuck.

Then I stopped doing what everyone told me to do and built my own system from scratch. These three strategies completely changed everything.

**The 5-Minute Power Plan:** Every morning I pick my top 3 priorities and block 90 minutes for each. That's it. No complex planning, no fancy apps. I now finish more in one focused day than I used to in a scattered week.

**The 2-Breath Reset:** When stress hits hard, I pause everything. Inhale for 4 counts, exhale for 6, repeat three times. Sounds too simple to work, but it's like hitting a mental reset button. My nervous system calms down instantly and I can think clearly again.

**The Micro-Win Loop:** Instead of staring at my massive to-do list, I knock out one tiny task immediately. Momentum builds fast, and suddenly I'm on a roll. Turns out motivation follows action, not the other way around.

These three things pulled me out of the ""busy but broke"" trap. I was working 12-hour days and had nothing to show for it. Now I work 6-7 focused hours and actually see results.

I documented the complete system in two guides: **Time Masters** (crush procrastination, maximize focus, reclaim your time) and **Stop Managing Stress** (manage anxiety, protect your energy, build resilience). There's also a bundle with both for people who want the full system.

**Halloween Special: 50% off everything until November 5th.** After that, prices go back to normal. This is the cheapest these will ever be.

**DM me if you're interested — I'll send you everything directly.**

Happy to answer questions about any of these strategies or share more about how I structure my workday.

I’ve been under a lot of stress lately — I recently lost both of my grandparents and I’m currently caring for a loved one with stage IV cancer. Since then, I’ve developed acid reflux that keeps getting worse.

What’s strange is that when I go on vacation or leave my home environment, my reflux completely disappears. I can eat almost anything and feel fine. But as soon as I come back home, it flares up again.

It’s starting to feel like my body is stuck in a constant stress mode. I’m open to any advice or strategies that could help me manage chronic stress and ease my symptoms — whether it’s lifestyle changes, therapy techniques, or even medications that are gentle on the stomach.

reddit,stress,1om6w0p,Accurate-Breadfruit,f615a293a09b1c41,Miserable in shared accommodation,"I (35F) moved to Spain 6 years ago working in schools and didn’t think at almost 36 I would still have no option but to continue living in shared accommodation. I have tried to channel my best positivity but I literally feel depressed. It builds up and I cry in my room or outside when I need to leave for some space in sheer frustration. 

I was living in a girls flat for 4 years and while they were clean on the most part, they were so inconsiderate. I know people want to have sexy time but my God it’s awful to be forced to listen to it constantly. The girls brought tinder dates after tinder dates. Shirtless men wandering around. Then a bf basically moved in without paying. Parties in the living room next to my room until 5am on a Monday.

Now I moved into another flat and turns out it’s all guys. I just can’t catch a break. The first lot of guys didn’t bring visitors but they equally stressed me out with constantly gaming or watching football with loud volume in the living room day and night which I have to walk through to get to my room.

Yeh I know that’s part of shared living but I just want to sit here and complain for a minute. Don’t get me started on the guy in the flat that does explosive diarrhoea and won’t clean it up. I even put a polite note about keeping the one shared bathroom clean and he tore it down in disgust. Well guess what, I was more in disgust at brushing the toilet bowl clean twice a day just so i can use it without wanting to throw up!!!

Now diarrhoea man somehow has a girlfriend and she comes over, they are all over each other in the living room which we have to walk through to get to the bathroom and it’s so awkward. They watch movies loud. This evening he was giving her a foot massage with lotion in the living room just like that’s totally normal and then I had to listen to the sex after that. He is in the bedroom right next to mine and it’s like the walls are paper.

Why do people bring girls or guys over without thinking about other people? It absolutely sucks. They aren’t paying for a couples room. And they act as if it’s their entire flat and I feel like a weird guest.

Plus they ignored my request to lock the door when they leave. At my last flat we were robbed because we didn’t lock the door. Of course the landlord absolutely doesn’t care about any of this. I’ve also had food stolen, my toiletries used, I’m the only one that doesn’t want to live in a pig mess.

I have a low income as a marketing freelancer, and I’ve been applying for jobs but getting consistent rejection. It’s miserable not being able to move into a studio flat or one bedroom place at my age. I honestly don’t know what to do, I hate not being able to relax in my flat, not being able to use the living room, using a diarrhoea covered toilet, having just one shelf in the fridge, walking in on date nights, doors slamming, and people shagging like tomorrow is the end of the world.

I can’t move with my parents because they will give me a nervous breakdown. I love Spain I just can’t seem to make it work- I don’t know what to do",3,3,2025-11-02T03:12:10+00:00,https://reddit.com/r/Stress/comments/1om6w0p/miserable_in_shared_accommodation/,Negative

I (47, male, manager) have been noticing for some time now that I am somehow constantly “on the verge of burnout”. I function, do my job, exercise, take care of the household and family - but inside I'm almost constantly irritable, tense or annoyed.

Some days things are going great, I'm motivated and clear-headed - and then things can change within minutes: neck pain, pressure in the eyes, irritability, everything annoys me. Afterwards it often takes me hours to calm down again.

I don't have depression and I don't lie apathetic on the sofa either. I do everything, but somehow my system is always in overdrive. 
A naturopath called it “full throttle at a green light” – when I’m feeling well, I accelerate too much until I’m back against the wall.
Lately I've come across the term burn-on - that's pretty accurate.

I would be interested in:
👉 Does anyone know this constant fluctuation between “it’s going well” and “it’s all too much”?
👉 How do you deal with it when your body and head are on strike at the same time, but you have to keep functioning?
👉 What helped you get out of this constant state of tension in the long term?

I am grateful for honest experiences.

She worked hard, loved what she did, and always seemed strong from the outside. But when she finally sat down to talk, she said something that stayed with me.

“I am not just tired,” she whispered, “I am tired inside.”

That line hit me. Because it is true for so many of us. We wake up, go through the day, do what we must, and still feel like we are running on empty. It is not just about sleep or rest. It is the kind of tired that comes from carrying too much, for too long.

She began to make small changes. Talking more. Taking small pauses between her calls. Stepping outside to feel the sun. Slowly, the light started to return to her eyes.

It reminded me that stress does not always shout. Sometimes it sits quietly behind a smile. And sometimes, the bravest thing you can do is stop for a moment and admit that you are not okay and that it is okay to say so.

A few weeks ago, I posted here about feeling like my brain was running at 200% with 100 tabs open, and I was just completely burned out (especially from work and my own high expectations). The advice I got was incredible.

**The good news:** I took the advice. I did a ""digital detox"" (looking at you, TikTok), started meditating, and have been forcing myself to actually unplug and see the sunrise. It's working. My daytime anxiety is much lower, and that constant ""buzz"" in my head has quieted down a lot.

**The lingering problem:** My sleep is still a mess.

Even though I'm more relaxed during the day, the moment my head hits the pillow, it's like all the ""noises"" and thoughts I held back just rush in. I'm still having a really hard time shutting my brain *off* to actually fall asleep.

I've been talking to friends about it. Some suggested supplements, which I'm open to. My only thing is, **I'm pretty resistant to trying melatonin.** I've just heard too many mixed things about it (weird dreams, feeling groggy, or becoming dependent on it).

So, I wanted to ask this community: **For those of you who also get that ""tired but wired"" feeling at night, what** ***non-melatonin*** **alternatives have you found that actually help quiet your mind?**

I'm not really looking for something that knocks me out cold, but more just... something to help me gently close down all those brain tabs.

reddit,stress,1oiaeo8,Complete_System_6106,ebf9fcf61843952c,Why Yoga for Mental Health?,"We all have a mental health, yet we often forget to check up if everything is going well 

Yoga for Mental Health, it’s a Path Back to Yourself!

There was a time when I thought yoga was only about stretching, but my studies and my teachers showed me the opposite.

Yoga isn’t about touching your toes, it’s about what you discover on the way down.

In a world that moves too fast, where our minds never stop and our bodies carry the weight of stress, yoga offers something we rarely give ourselves, a refuge to pause.

I’ve seen it over and over again: when we start moving with awareness, something inside us begins to soften.

The breath deepens.

The mind quiets.

And suddenly, the space that felt heavy starts to feel lighter.

Why Yoga Supports Mental Health?

When we practice yoga, we activate the parasympathetic nervous system, our body’s natural “rest and digest” response.

This lowers stress hormones, regulates emotions, and helps us return to balance and calm.

But beyond the science, yoga teaches us emotional presence, how to meet our thoughts and feelings with compassion rather than judgment.

Every pose, every breath, becomes a practice of letting go and coming home to ourselves.

We Don’t Need to Escape Life to Find Peace!

We don’t need hours or a perfect space.
From my proper experience, even 10 minutes of mindful movement or breathing can change the tone of our day.

Yoga isn’t about escaping what’s hard, it’s about learning to stay present with it, gently, until it transforms.

Over time, you begin to carry that awareness into daily life, pausing before reacting, breathing before speaking, and showing yourself and others kindness when it is most needed.

💛 A Gentle Invitation

If your mind feels heavy or scattered lately, try this:

Find a quiet spot, close your eyes, and take three slow, deep breaths.

Notice how your body feels right now, without trying to change anything.

That’s the beginning of yoga.

It’s not about perfection, it’s about presence.

And sometimes, one mindful breath can be the first step toward healing.",2,1,2025-10-28T14:10:12+00:00,https://reddit.com/r/Stress/comments/1oiaeo8/why_yoga_for_mental_health/,Positive

reddit,stress,1oh719x,Cute_Matcha6767,9fe3cefe57f5990c,Been feeling bad these past months.,"Hi everyone, I’m not sure if what I’m going through is just stress or something that actually needs to be checked out. For the past few months (about 4 now), I’ve been super stressed with college trying to pass my classes, writing tons of essays and research papers, and constantly worrying that I wouldn’t make it. I ended up passing, but during that time, I started overthinking a lot, even convincing myself I might be pregnant (which I wasn’t).

Lately, I’ve been really constipated and having bad stomach pain. Some days I would have no appetite and only eat once or twice a day, usually skipping breakfast and just eating dinner or a snack. I found out that can cause gastritis, which just made me worry even more. I can’t stop stressing that it could be something serious like cancer or IBD, lol.

I also have this bad habit where, when I feel like something’s wrong, I immediately look it up online. Then I start thinking I have whatever serious condition I just read about. That makes me feel even worse I’ll get headaches, nausea, or sharp belly pain. But when I distract myself or stay busy, I start to feel better (still constipated though, lol). That’s actually what made me go to the doctor the constipation.

My doctor said it’s probably IBS, but I’m still not sure if all this stress I’ve had for months could’ve caused it. I’ve had stomach issues since I was a teen, but never this bad. I’ve been trying to find things I enjoy to relax, but it’s been hard. I also went through depression back in 2020 and would sometimes go a day or two without eating.

Just wondering if anyone else has gone through something similar or if I should ask for more tests or scans to be safe.",1,1,2025-10-27T06:14:59+00:00,https://reddit.com/r/Stress/comments/1oh719x/been_feeling_bad_these_past_months/,Negative

That’s when my journey began: with just 10 minutes of meditation lying down in my bed, every single morning. It didn’t require a retreat, a quiet space, or any special equipment, just a commitment to show up for myself.  
  
That’s exactly why I created my 30 Days Meditation Program for Beginners; a journey designed for busy minds who want calm without complicating their lives.  
  
Each day brings a new short mindfulness practice, helping you reconnect, refocus, and breathe easier, no matter how full your schedule is.

I never cared much about grades or just school in general and my parents cared, but all they did was scream at me whenever I didn’t do as well as someone on something, they never actually helped. My dad also missed majority of my life. High school wasn’t too bad, I participated in all sorts of clubs with leadership positions, had a sport that I was in for 4 years, won a few awards, and had an internship. Life felt decent back then but I was constantly stressed. Senior year, I was going to end my life before I turned 18. I eventually pulled through after many talks with my mom and went to college right after high school, even though deep down I knew I wasn’t ready. Something inside me broke a long time ago and it has only started to heal recently, after 4 years. 

Now, my life is much calmer and I’m still in college. But I’m still stressed. Except that stress is different now because all of a sudden, I realize that I haven’t done ANYTHING productive besides just being in school. I made the mistake of checking out what everyone else I know has been doing and the things on their linkedin’s are crazy. 

I realize that I need to put myself out there again, but gods, the idea of it terrifies me. I don’t even know how to take the first step.

All I want is to get away from this place, I want to go to another college that’s far away from home so that way I can decrease the chances of seeing people in this town. But unfortunately I don’t think I could transfer anywhere now because of how bad my grades are currently.

I initially blamed stress because I was working in a toxic environment and my husband was diagnosed with stage IV cancer.

I tried PPIs but developed a rash. My symptoms disappeared for a few months, then returned. I quit my job to care for my husband and started college, but my stomach issues came back last year along with severe migraines.

Allergy testing showed mild sensitivities to corn, oats, rice, eggs, and many fruits and vegetables. Skin tests were positive for mold, pollen, and animals. My allergist said most sensitivities were mild, but I should avoid peanuts and walnuts.

Persistent acid reflux led to an endoscopy, which showed:

Reactive chemical gastropathy (no inflammation, no H. pylori)

Acid reflux

Swelling and redness in the stomach


Right now, I’m waiting for follow-up. I’ve noticed I feel much better at the beach, and during those times I can eat almost anything — which makes me think stress is a major factor.

Questions:

1. Has anyone experienced IBS or gastritis strongly linked to stress?


2. What activities or routines help reduce stomach symptoms for you?

reddit,stress,1oewq10,ChickenLast2545,a4d15875607a6a0d,Burnt out and dwelling less ambitious about my dream job,"Not sure how to start this so I'll just jump into it
Currently I'm a 27 yr old female working in the pet industry. I realized a few years ago, after working many different pet handling positions(vet tech and kennel tech) that I wanted to pursue grooming and actually become certified. I ended up getting a connection into a family grooming business that's very small (5 people including myself). Ultimately what made me decide to continue working here was the fact that they were going to pay for my schooling, and it was a weekly pay of $20/hr being a bather for the owner of the store. I've been here for about a year a half now and I feel MISERABLE. I will list in order the dilemmas I've been experiencing since starting to work there. 

1) Empty promises with schooling.
After confrontation and asking why I'm not enrolled yet after a specified date, I was told the owner hadn't saved enough and after a yr they had only saved $2k for my school. It's 10k...

2) The other owner, who is a cat groomer, contributing in the death of my cat. She took my cat out of his bag without permission and bathed him. About a week later he had ringworm and it was a constant stressful battle and he got it twice. The process of getting the ringworm off of him too was very stressful because the cat groomer would deliberately take the sulfur home with her so that I couldn't bathe my cat.  After about a good month of fighting the ringworm and getting rid of fugus, it also had turned out he had a foreign object inside of him. Supposedly the Vet said it was very round. Granted he was the type of cat to mess with things, but he would never ingest random objects. He never even ate fries like that... Anyways he has to be euthanize just because his health kept depleting.

3) Not only am I a dog bather, but I'm also a maintenance person, deep cleaner and ig a damn maid too since no one can clean after themselves. I know this typically a given with most jobs but Jesus 🙃

4) Even though my job legitimately does have a schedule, the schedule is never accurate. The manager always forgets to schedule a dog, will add an extra one for the $, or will accept dogs that come in 2-3 hrs later and of course guess who has to bathe the dog 🙄

5) No accountability or help in any regards to anything.

6) I have no connection to any of the workers, to the point where I literally hate when they talk to me bc they're so boring. And even if I do try to have any type of connection or talk to them it's not like they care to listen so I don't want to waste my breath

7) The cat groomer assaulted me by shoving me out the door, and threw my stuff out the store because I was snacking 10 mins before my customers started coming in

I could keep going on but I believe I already made the list pretty long. I feel like the cons are starting to outweigh the pros and I really only wanted to work here because of school and the $ but at this point I'm just over it. I know the job market isn't the best right now, but I quite literally would rather be unemployed than suffering in silence at this nightmare of a job. Let me know y'all's thoughts because I'm really debating quitting this week, though I have nothing really lined up.

Until I noticed how shallow and fast it became whenever I felt tense. My heart rate went up, my shoulders tightened, and I was literally “stuck” in my chest.

It was only when I consciously started slowing my breath that I noticed the difference. By exhaling a little longer than I inhaled, my heart rate calmed down and my thoughts became less rushed. This happens because slow breathing activates the vagus nerve, the part of your nervous system that supports rest and recovery.

Since then, I’ve kept experimenting with different ways to guide my breathing, including simple tools that make the rhythm tangible. It taught me that calm is not something you think, but something you breathe.

I’ll try to keep it short but I am 22 years old and I  recently moved out of my dads place and went to go stay with my aunt (moms side). Before I moved out my dad and I got into a physical fight and we had tons of verbal arguments within the 10 days I was living there (I was supposed to stay there for the whole month of October).

My mom, brother and I, decided to stay with my dad because we had nowhere else to go, we got kicked out of our old house and weren’t going to stay in a shelter because it just wasn’t safe for my brother (he’s 11). 

Fast forward, I’ve been living with my aunt and my mom and brother are still with my dad (my mom and her sister/my aunt don’t get along anymore). It’s weird not being under the same roof as my mom. I feel my physical health has been taking a toll and Google said it’s from stress.

 I have the same exact nightmare and if not a new nightmare almost every night and it makes me fear having to go back to bed. I’ve been having crazy bad headaches, heart palpitations & night sweats that force me to have to shower and change my bedding. I’ll randomly burst out into tears and don’t know why.

When you’re stressed, cortisol (the stress hormone) signals your liver to release stored glucose into the bloodstream. It’s the same “fight or flight” mechanism our bodies evolved with, but in today’s world, it gets triggered by work deadlines, arguments, or even endless notifications.

Over time, these small glucose surges can lead to fatigue, brain fog, and in some cases, even increase the risk of prediabetes or insulin resistance.

I recently came across a good article that breaks this down with research and some simple ways to manage it: https://buttondown.com/beat-the-spike/archive/the-glucose-stress-connection-why-your-mind-can/

(For reference I’ve had anxiety for most of my life and this is completely different from what I’ve experienced)

June this year I started feeling fatigued and low energy. By July 1st I was experiencing full blown panic attacks where it felt like my adrenals were constantly going off (I could physically feel it in my stomach area) I went to the ER they said nothing is wrong and gave me Ativan. Things did not start improving over weeks which caused dormant viruses to wake up (EBV HV6) because my body was under stress attacks. I’ve been doing treatments for my immune system (ozone, vitamin therapy) all work great but my nervous system is still completely on edge. It’s OCTOBER now and I am STILL feeling like crap. I started buspar 2 weeks ago to see if it helps my nervous system calm down. Haven’t felt any affects yet from it good or bad. Yes I’ve been through trauma years ago, yes I feel like I’ve been in flight or fight for years, but I am basically bedridden at this point. The second I push my energy too far I crash for 3 days physically. It feels like I can’t handle any amount of stress or adrenaline constantly.


All of my bloodwork is normal, thyroid everything. It gets increasingly worse before my cycle. Although I do believe MCAS, histamine imbalances and low methylation can be causing some of this, I need someone to point me in the direction of healing.

reddit,stress,1obpfi4,NeatStretch793,67e4c6722bb025d3,I can’t cope with anything anymore,"Lately I feel like I can’t cope with anything in my life.

For context- about 2 years ago we had our first child and I suffered with some postpartum issues. I still feel like I have a hard time coping with any difficulty - if he doesn’t eat well, sleep well etc. My son now is in daycare and I’m back to work now. Work is easy and not stressful, but my son is sick all the time (and so are we now), which is hard

On top of all that- we need a bigger house. We live in a small place that with a child we have no room to do much anymore. We had to firstly sell a condo, which I had pre marriage to my husband. Not that bad as we didn’t live there. Then after we had to sell this house which I found so stressful. We had to pack up, stage it and go out for showings. Keep in mind we have a toddler and dog too. Then within a week of that we bought our new house. We had to go to viewings.

Now that we’re doing that it’s getting all the paperwork done, packing etc. this all sounds like it’s easy but the second something is not as it should be I get a tight chest, panic and cry, I cannot cope.

In addition, my mom has had medical issues- she’s largely better from but it’s been upsetting. 

I have had stomach issues (my son last week had something stomach issue related and a cold so I guess I have it), and I just took a half sick day from work. What can I do here?

Now that they are back I’m confused. I feel like I’m under the normal college stress, nothing crazy! If anything, last fall I was WAY more stressed and have been doing a lot better this fall. I’m wondering if I’m subconsciously stressed, and if so, how do I figure out what I’m stressed about? Has anyone else dealt with stress hives? Are these stress hives?

But recently, ever since this year that I turned 15 really I’ve been so stressed about not wanting to grow up and I hope this doesn’t sound dramatic or strange or anything but it’s true like I wanna stay a kid and I don’t wanna be an adult with much more responsibilities and stuff because I already can’t handle the few responsibilities I have now. 

I feel like managing bills and finances when I’m older will just bring more stress into my life and worsen my mental health. I feel like my health is worsening and I can’t enjoy my life or life in the moment because I’m always reminiscing about the past when I was 13/14. 
I know I’m still young and 16 is not old at all but it seems like every birthday I get more and more stressed out. I just wanna be a kid again where I barely had to worry about anything and play with my toys or whatever. 

I also freak out because I feel like when I talk to kids younger than me I feel too old and that I can’t relate to them and Its weird to me tht how when you were looking at kids that are your age currently when you were younger, they seemed so grown up but now actually getting to that age u realise the were not grown at all. 

Idk if 16 is supposed to be an adult or still a child like idk. I miss being a kid where there was more opportunities and the world seemed more open and I could be an astronaut or famous singer or whatever but now I’m actually getting to the age where I’m realising I have to be more realistic about life and it’s not exciting anymore. 

Nothing excites me like it did as a kid and the world just seems so boring and depressing now. I cant enjoy things like a used to and idk what to do, is this what being an adult is like? Is this what my adult like will feel like? I have also been experiencing extremely dark thoughts recently of doing something to myself or doing things to myself but thankfully it’s just thoughts and not me actually carrying those thoughts out, but at this rate I think I might soon.

I’ve been experiencing weekends full of stress headaches, belly pain starting Sunday mornings because of having to work again the next day, neck and shoulder completely locked, no enjoyment of family and friend activities anymore, sleep very bad, old addictive ‘coping mechanisms’ returning again, etc. I switched jobs a year and a half ago, love the new work location, the colleagues, and the payment. Unfortunately the work itself is very stressful also without perspective in things changing.

I called in sick about two weeks ago. Luckily where I live there is room for time out to get back on track. Spoke to my family doctor, she suggested one batch of sleeping aides and anti depressants for a while. Also through my employer I’ll be seeing a therapist.

Now I spent the days waking up with my family and going out into nature, and unfortunately swiping and doomscrolling too much. I have hope things will improve, but it’s tough.

Just wanted to get this off my plate. ",7,2,2025-10-13T18:01:45+00:00,https://reddit.com/r/Stress/comments/1o5r5rv/called_in_sick/,Negative
